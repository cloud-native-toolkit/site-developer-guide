Typically a squad lead or lead developer install and setup these tools after the\ninitial inception workshop. The objective of this is to reduce the amount of time a team needs to configure and prepare their Kubernetes or OpenShift development environments.\nSome key benefits of this is that it makes the whole development lifecycle for Kubernetes and OpenShift\nconsistent and simpler thank the out of the box experience.\n\nThe installation is managed with Terraform and it enables it to be modular in configuration\nso tools can be easily disabled or new tools added. This combination of tools are proven in the\nindustry to deliver real value for modern cloud native development.\n\nThe Red Hat Innovation Lab has a very similar approach to how they deliver success with OpenShift, view their approach [here](https://github.com/rht-labs/labs-ci-cd).\n\nThis repo contains Terraform resources that will deploy the following development tools into a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster.\n\n- IBM Container Service Cluster (3 nodes) for Kubernetes or OpenShift\n- Create *dev*,*test*,*staging* and *tools* namespaces\n- Install the following tools:\n    - [Jenkins CI](https://jenkins.io/)\n    - [Argo CD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/)\n    - [SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org/)\n    - [Pack Broker](https://docs.pact.io/)\n    - [Artifactory](https://jfrog.com/open-source/)\n    - [Eclipse CHE](https://www.eclipse.org/che/)\n\n- Create and bind the following Cloud Services to your Cluster:\n    - [AppID Application Authentication](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/appid?topic=appid-service-access-management)\n    - [Cloudant NoSQL Database](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Cloudant?topic=cloudant-getting-started)\n    - [Cloud Object Storage Storage](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/cloud-object-storage?topic=cloud-object-storage-getting-started)\n    - [LogDNA Logging](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Log-Analysis-with-LogDNA?topic=LogDNA-getting-started)\n    - [SysDig Monitoring](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/Monitoring-with-Sysdig?topic=Sysdig-getting-started)\n    - [PostgreSQL](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/services/databases-for-postgresql?topic=databases-for-postgresql-about) (used by SonarQube)\n\n## Development Tools\n\n![Provisioned environment](catalyst-provisioned-environment.png)\n\n### Guides\n\nThe following Guides explain how to create and deploy applications using Continuous Integration with Jenkins. They help explain how to integrate code analysis into your applications with SonarQube. They explain how to move applications into test, staging and production using Continous Deployment techniques with Artifactory and Argo CD and much more.\n\n| Topic                     | Tool           |Description | Guide                               |\n| -----------------------   |:-------------- |------------| ----------------------------------:|\n| Cluster configuration     | Kube/OpenShift | Explanation on how the tools are integrated using Secrets and ConfigMaps                                 | [Guide](/guides/cluster-configuration) |\n| Continuous Integration    | Jenkins        | Explain how you can use Jenkins to delivery Continuous Integration                                       | [Guide](./docs/JENKINS.md)        |\n| Code Analysis             | SonarQube      | Explain how code scanning and analysis can help you manage a quality gate                                | [Guide](./docs/SONAR.md)         |\n| Artifact and Helm Storage | Artifactory    | Separation of Helm Chart content into a artifact storage system helps with Continous Delivery            | [Guide](./docs/ARTIFACTORY.md)    |\n| Continuous Deployment     | ArgoCD         | Evolving a project to Continuous Delivery is easy with Argo CD this explains how this can be done        | [Guide](./docs/ARGOCD.md)         |\n| Contract API Testing      | Pact           | Managing API contracts is key for decoupled software                                                     | [Guide](./docs/PACT.md)                         |\n| Logging                   | LogDNA         | How to manage your software logging with LogDNA                                                          | [Guide](./docs/LOGDNA.md)               |\n| Monitoring                | SysDig         | Validating performance and throughput with SysDig                                                        | [Guide](./docs/SYSDIG.md)         |\n| Cloud Service Integration | IBM Cloud      | Extending software with integration with Database, AI and other high value cloud services                | [Guide](./docs/IBMCLOUD.md)       |\n\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"46e561f7caec14bad49066580e04442b","counter":458,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Overview"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Overview\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\nUse this developer guide to get familar with using the IBM Garage for Cloud Developer tools\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink>Project setup</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Development</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Work in a branch</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Sass and CSS Modules</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>VS Code</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n# IBM Garage for Cloud\n## Developer Tools\n\n### Overview\n\nThe Developer Tools have been designed to help a team configure a set of popular open source tools that can enable\ncloud native development.
