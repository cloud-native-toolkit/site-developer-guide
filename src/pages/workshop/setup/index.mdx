## 1. Create OpenShift Cluster

- Create an OpenShift Cluster for example:
  - The 8 hours free Cluster on [IBM Open Labs](https://developer.ibm.com/openlabs/openshift) select lab 6 `Bring Your Own Application`
  - Deploy a Cluster on IBM Cloud VPC2 using the [Toolkit](/getting-started-day-0/provision-cluster/ibm-cloud-vpc)
  - On other Clouds using docs from [cloudnativetoolkit.dev/multi-cloud](https://cloudnativetoolkit.dev/getting-started-day-0/plan-installation/multi-cloud)
  - IBM internal DTE Infrastructure access via [IBM VPN](https://ccp-ui.csplab.intranet.ibm.com/ ) or [IBM CSPLAB](https://ccp-ui.apps.labprod.ocp.csplab.local/)

## 2. Install IBM Cloud Native Toolkit

- Use one of the install options for example the [Quick Install](https://cloudnativetoolkit.dev/getting-started-day-0/install-toolkit/quick-install)
    ```bash
    curl -sfL get.cloudnativetoolkit.dev | sh -
    ```

## 3. Setup IBM Cloud Native Toolkit Workshop

- Install the foundation for the workshops
    ```bash
    curl -sfL workshop.cloudnativetoolkit.dev | sh -
    ```

    **Notes**: 
    - The username and password for Git Admin is `toolkit` `toolkit`.  
    - Usernames `user01` through `user15` are configured with a password of `password`.
    - Username `userdemo` is configured with the password `password`. You can use this username if using the workshop environment
    for self study or giving a demo.  If you are preparing the environment for a workshop you can remove `userdemo`
    by running the `uninstall-userdemo.sh` script which is part of the [workshop](https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/cloud-native-toolkit-workshop) scripts.

## 4. (Optional) Customization of the IBM Cloud Native Toolkit Workshop

  - You can customize the Workshop environment by cloning the [workshop](https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/cloud-native-toolkit-workshop) repo
  
  - Some of the most common customizations are:

    - You can create more than 15 users by setting a `USER_COUNT` environment variable. For example to configure 30 users use the command
        ```bash      
        export USER_COUNT=30 
        ```

    - You can create more than 15 projects by setting a `PROJECT_COUNT` environment variable. For example to configure 30 projects use the command
        ```bash      
        export PROJECT_COUNT=30 
        ```

    - You can add additional users to the workshop clusters.
      - Create a file with one user id per line. 
      **IMPORTANT: there needs to be newline after the last entry.**
      For example a `users.txt` file with content.  
        ```bash      
        additionaluserID
        anotheruserID
        someuserID

        ```
      **Note:** For Openshift clusters on IBM Cloud (ROKS) the user ids are their IBM IDs (email address) all lowercase 
      with an uppercase `IAM#` prefix added to the beginning. For example.
        ```bash      
        IAM#additionaluserid@email.com
        IAM#anotheruserid@email.com
        IAM#someuserid@email.com

        ```
      - Create a `ADDITIONAL_USERS_FILE` environment variable with the path and name of the file.
        ```bash      
        export ADDITIONAL_USERS_FILE=users.txt
        ```
      - The additional users will be granted the `self-provisioner` role, meaning they can create new Openshift Projects.
        If you wish to remove this permission set an environment 
      varable `ADDITIONAL_USERS_SELF_PROVISIONER` with a value of `N`
        ```bash      
        export ADDITIONAL_USERS_SELF_PROVISIONER=N
        ```
      
  - Once you have finished configuring your customizations, login to the cluster from the cli and run the `scripts/install.sh` script to perform the install.
