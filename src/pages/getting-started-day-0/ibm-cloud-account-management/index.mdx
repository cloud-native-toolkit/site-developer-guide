## Roles

A <Globals name="env" /> is installed and used by users acting in four roles:
- **Account owner(s)**
- **Account managers**
- **Environment administrators**
- **Environment users**

This diagram from [Resource Access Management](/toolkit-resources/resource-mgmt#access-group-example) 
shows the relationship of these access groups to a pair of development environments:

![Access groups example](../../images/access-example.png)

### Account owner(s)

The `account owner(s)` is the user who owns the account or users who have been granted super-user access to the account
at the same level as the account owner.

An account owner must create the access group for account managers. The account owner will:

- Create an `ACCT-MGR-IAM-ADMIN` access group using the `acp-mgr` script
- Add a functional ID, configured using the `acp-iaas` script, with API keys for the account managers

### Account managers

The `account managers` are an account owner or other users with [account management permissions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-account-services)

As described in [Configure Account](/admin/config-account), the account managers can set up the resource groups 
and access groups needed to install and use the environments. For each environment, the account managers will:
- Create a resource group
- Create an access group named `<resource_group>-ADMIN` using the script `acp-admin`
- Create an access group named `<resource_group>-USER` using the script `acp-user`

### Environment administrators

The `environment administrators` are users in the account 
with [permissions to create services in the environment's resource group](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-userroles#platformroles). In
this case, the "environment" is scoped to the `resource group`. Environment administrators are granted broad access
to create, manage, and destroy services and resources within a given `resource group`.

### Environment users

The `environment users` are users in the account with [permissions to use existing services in the environment's resource group](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-userroles#service_access_roles) 
(e.g. developers, data scientists, etc.). They are consumers of the services and resources that have been provisioned in
order to build and deploy business applications.

## Architecture

The [Environment Architecture](/arch/environment) page shows the structure of the environment that will be installed. Depending upon
the approach for development teams, each [development team](/arch/teams) can be assigned its own (small) environment or
multiple teams can share a single environment. The environment structure is designed to support best practices for 
a [cloud-native application architecture](/arch/application), including designing applications that 
are [built to manage](/arch/manageable).
