<Tab label="Private Catalog" open="true">

<InlineNotification>

These steps assume the private catalog has been created and populated with the <Globals name="shortName" /> tiles during
the [prepare the account](../prepare-account#3.-create-the-private-catalog) steps.

</InlineNotification>

<br />

1. Log in to the <Globals name="ic" /> Console.
2. Select **Catalog** from the top menu.
3. From the side menu, select your catalog from the drop-down list (e.g. `Team Catalog`). (**IBM Cloud catalog** should be selected initially.)
4. Click **Private** on the side menu to see the private catalog entries
5. Click on the **221. Cloud-Native Classic cluster** tile
6. Enter values for the variables list provided.

   | **Variable**          | **Description**                                                                               | **eg. Value**                 |

7. Check the box to accept the **Apache 2** license for the tile.
8. Click **Install** to start the install process

This will kick off the installation of the <Globals name="shortName" /> using an
IBM Cloud Private Catalog Tile. The progress can be reviewed from the
**Schematics** entry

<Tab label="Iteration Zero">

### A. Download the Iteration Zero scripts

<br />

1. Clone the [ibm-garage-iteration-zero](https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/ibm-garage-iteration-zero) Git repository to your local filesystem

    ```shell
    git clone git@github.com:cloud-native-toolkit/ibm-garage-iteration-zero.git
    ```

### B. Configure the credentials

<br />

1. In a terminal, change to the `ibm-garage-iteration-zero` cloned directory

    ```shell
    cd ibm-garage-iteration-zero
    ```

2. Copy the `credentials.template` file to a file named `credentials.properties`

    ```shell
    cp credentials.template credentials.properties
    ```

   **Note:** `credentials.properties` is already listed in `.gitignore` to prevent the
   private credentials from being committed to the git repository

3. Update the value for the `ibmcloud.api.key` property in `credentials.properties` with your <Globals name="ic" /> API key

   **Note:** The API key should have been set up during [plan installation](/getting-started-0/prepare-account).

### C. Configure the environment variables

<br />

The settings for creating the <Globals name="shortName" /> on <Globals name="ic" /> are set in the `environment-ibmcloud.tfvars`
file in the `./terraform/settings` directory of the `ibm-garage-iteration-zero` repository.

There are a number of values that can be applied in the file, some required and some optional. Consult with
the following table to determine which values should be used:

| **Variable**          | **Required?** | **Description**                                                                     | **eg. Value**                 |

<br />

Update `environment-ibmcloud.tfvars` with the appropriate values for your installation. Particularly, be sure to set the
following values in order to provision a Classic cluster:

- `cluster_exists` to `false`
- `vpc_cluster` to `false`

### D. Configure the VLAN settings

The `vlan.tfvars` file in `terraform/settings` contains properties that define the classic infrastructure configuration in order to provision a
new cluster. Typical values look like this:

```shell script
vlan_datacenter="dal10"
public_vlan_id="2366011"
private_vlan_id="2366012"
```

You must set all of these specifically for your cluster. Use the values provided by the account manager.

- `vlan_datacenter` -- The zone in the region in which the cluster worker nodes will be provisioned
- `public_vlan_id` -- The public VLAN that the cluster will use
- `private_vlan_id` -- The private VLAN that the cluster will use

#### Optional: Generate the VLAN properties

The [IGC CLI](/getting-started/cli) can be used to generate these settings, to make the configuration as simple as possible.

If your account has numerous VLANs and you want your cluster to use specific ones, then skip this step and provide the
values by hand. This tool is for users who don't know what these required settings should be and want a simple way to
gather reasonable defaults for their particular account.

1. Log in using the <Globals name="igcli" />
2. Target the region where the cluster will be provisioned with the <Globals name="igcli" />
    ```shell script
    ibmcloud target -r {region}
    ```
2. Run the VLAN command
    ```shell script
    igc vlan
    ```
3. Copy the output values from the CLI Command into your `vlan.tfvars` files

### E. (Optional) Customize the installed components

<br />

The `terraform/stages` directory contains the default set of stages that define the
modules that will be applied to the environment. The stages can be customized to change
the makeup of the environment that is provisioned by either removing or adding stages from/to the
`terraform/stages` directory.

**Note:** The stages occasionally have dependencies on other stages (e.g. most all
depend on the cluster module, many depend on the namespace module, etc.) so be aware of those
dependencies as you start making changes. Dependencies are reflected in the `module.{stage name}` references
in the stage variable list.

The `terraform/stages/catalog` directory contains some optional
stages that are prep-configured and can be dropped into the `terraform/stages` directory. Other
modules are available from the [Garage Terraform Modules](https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/garage-terraform-modules)
catalog and can be added as stages to the directory as well. Since this is Terraform,
any other Terraform scripts and modules can be added to the `terraform/stages` directory
as desired.

### F. Run the installation

<br />

1. Open a terminal to the `ibm-garage-iteration-zero` directory
2. Launch a [Developer Tools Docker container](https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/ibm-garage-cli-tools "Cloud Garage Tools Docker image") from which the Terraform scripts will be run

    ```shell
    ./launch.sh
    ```

   This will download the Cloud Garage Tools Docker image that contains all the necessary tools to execute Terraform scripts
   and exec shell into the running container. When the container starts it
   mounts the filesystem's `./terraform/` directory as `/home/devops/src/` and loads the values from the
   `credentials.properties` file as environment variables.

3. Apply the Terraform by running the provided `runTerraform.sh` script

    ```shell
    ./runTerraform.sh
    ```

   This script collects the values provided in the `environment-ibmcloud.tfvars` and the
   stages defined in the `terraform/stages` to build the Terraform workspace. Along the way it
   will prompt for a couple pieces of information.

    1. Type of installation: `cluster`

       This prompt can be skipped by providing `--cluster` as an argument to `./runTerraform.sh`

    2. Handling of an old workspace (if applicable): `keep` or `delete`

       If you executed the script previously for the current cluster configuration and the workspace directory still
       exists then you will be prompted to either keep or delete the workspace directory. Keep the workspace directory if
       you want to use the state from the previous run as a starting point to either add or remove configuration. Delete
       the workspace if you want to start with a clean install of the Toolkit.

       This prompt can be skipped by providing `--delete` or `--keep` as an argument to `./runTerraform.sh`

    3. Verify the installation configuration

       The script will verify some basic settings and prompt if you want to proceed. After you select **Y** (for yes),
       the Terraform Apply process will begin to create the infrastructure and services for your environment.

       This prompt can be skipped by providing `--auto-approve` as an argument to `./runTerraform.sh`

   Creating a new cluster takes about 1.5 hours on average (but can also take considerably longer)
   and the rest of the process takes about 30 minutes.

## Troubleshooting

If you find that the Terraform provisioning has failed, for Private Catalog delete the workspace and for Iteration Zero  try re-running the `runTerraform.sh` script again.
The state will be saved and Terraform will try and apply the configuration to match the desired end state.

If you find that some of the services have failed to create in the time allocated, try the following with Iteration zero:

1. Manually delete the service instances in your resource group
3. Re-run the `runTerraform.sh` script with the `--delete` argument to clean up the state

    ```shell
    ./runTerraform.sh --delete
    ```
