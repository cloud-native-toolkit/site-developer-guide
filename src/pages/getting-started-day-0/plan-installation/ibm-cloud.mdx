Provides the considerations and steps to prepare the <Globals name="ic" /> account for
an installation of <Globals name="shortName" /> <Globals name="env" />.

</PageDescription>

<Accordion>
<AccordionItem title="Background on account management">

To understand how the process is performed, keep these concepts in mind.

### Roles

A <Globals name="env" /> is installed and used by users acting in four roles:
- **Account owner(s)**
- **Account managers**
- **Environment administrators**
- **Environment users**

This diagram from [Resource Access Management](/toolkit-resources/resource-mgmt#access-group-example) 
shows the relationship of these access groups to a pair of development environments:

![Access groups example](../../images/access-example.png)

#### Account owner(s)

The `account owner(s)` is the user who owns the account or users who have been granted super-user access to the account
at the same level as the account owner.

An account owner must create the access group for account managers. The account owner will:

- Create an `ACCT-MGR-IAM-ADMIN` access group using the `acp-mgr` script
- Add a functional ID, configured using the `acp-iaas` script, with API keys for the account managers

#### Account managers

The `account managers` are an account owner or other users with [account management permissions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-account-services)

As described in [Configure Account](/admin/config-account), the account managers can set up the resource groups 
and access groups needed to install and use the environments. For each environment, the account managers will:
- Create a resource group
- Create an access group named `<resource_group>-ADMIN` using the script `acp-admin`
- Create an access group named `<resource_group>-USER` using the script `acp-user`

#### Environment administrators

The `environment administrators` are users in the account 
with [permissions to create services in the environment's resource group](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-userroles#platformroles). In
this case, the "environment" is scoped to the `resource group`. Environment administrators are granted broad access
to create, manage, and destroy services and resources within a given `resource group`.

#### Environment users

The `environment users` are users in the account with [permissions to use existing services in the environment's resource group](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-userroles#service_access_roles) 
(e.g. developers, data scientists, etc.). They are consumers of the services and resources that have been provisioned in
order to build and deploy business applications.

### Architecture

The [Environment Architecture](/arch/environment) page shows the structure of the environment that will be installed. Depending upon
the approach for development teams, each [development team](/arch/teams) can be assigned its own (small) environment or
multiple teams can share a single environment. The environment structure is designed to support best practices for 
a [cloud-native application architecture](/arch/application), including designing applications that 
are [built to manage](/arch/manageable).

</AccordionItem>
<AccordionItem title="1. Set up account managers access group" open="true">

The **account owner** creates this access group for account managers and adds the functional ID for managing 
API keys. See [Plan Installation > Roles](/getting-started-day-0/plan-installation/ibm-cloud#roles) for the overview of 
the roles involved. An account only needs one of these `account manager` access groups, which will be used to support all 
environments in the account.

In a new account, the account owner is the only user. Even after inviting other users, the account owner is initially 
the only user with the account management permissions needed to grant those permissions to other users. Therefore, it is
the account owner who must create the access group for account managers.

<InlineNotification>

The video in [Resource Access Management > Configuration Process](/toolkit-resources/resource-mgmt#configuration-process) 
shows how to perform the steps in this process.

</InlineNotification>

### A. Prepare to run scripts

We'll use some scripts in the steps below to help create access groups. Before using them, the scripts need to be 
downloaded and the environment needs to be prepared before running them.

#### i. Clone the Iteration Zero git repository

The [ibm-garage-iteration-zero](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/ibm-garage-iteration-zero) repository contains a 
number of scripts that support the administrative tasks. It also has contains the Terraform scripts for installing 
the <Globals name="shortName" /> <Globals name="env" />.)

```shell script
git clone git@github.com:ibm-garage-cloud/ibm-garage-iteration-zero.git
cd ibm-garage-iteration-zero
```

#### ii. Log in to <Globals name="ic" /> using the <Globals name="iccli" />

```shell script
ibmcloud login -a cloud.ibm.com -r <region>
```

### B. Create the access group for account managers

The account owner must create an access group to grant the necessary permissions for managing the account. A script has
been provided to automate the configuration of the policies. 

<InlineNotification>

**Note**: IBM Cloud has multiple [account management services](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-account-services), 
in addition to IAM: Billing, License and entitlement, Support center, etc. An easy way to grant access to these 
individually is to create an access group for administering each: `ACCT-MGR-BILLING-ADMIN`, `ACCT-MGR-LICENSE-ADMIN`, 
`ACCT-MGR-SUPPORT-ADMIN`. The group created below only has IAM capabilities, so we suggest `ACCT-MGR-IAM-ADMIN` for
its name.

</InlineNotification>

<br />

To create the access group for the account managers:
1. Create a new [access group](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-account_setup) and name it something 
like `ACCT-MGR-IAM-ADMIN` (all capital letters) (or name it after your account)
2. Run `./terraform/scripts/acp-mgr.sh` from the `ibm-garage-iteration-zero` repository to add the necessary policies 
to the access group
  ```shell script
  ./terraform/scripts/acp-mgr.sh ACCT-MGR-IAM-ADMIN
  ```
3. Add the users to the access group

<br />

The `./terraform/scripts/acp-mgr.sh` script adds policies that allow the user to:

- Create resource groups
- Invite users to the account
- Create access groups and manage access group membership
- Create clusters across all resources groups in the account
- Create service instances across all resource groups in the account
- Manage the IBM Cloud Container Registry (used as the environment's [image registry](/guides/image-registry))

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="2. Configure the account">

The account must provide a few resources that will be needed to install and use the <Globals name="shortName" /> <Globals name="env" />:
- Upgrade the image registry
- Create a resource group
- Create a pair of access groups for the admin and users

### A. Prepare to run scripts

We'll use some scripts in the steps below to help create access groups. Before using them, the scripts need to be 
downloaded and the environment needs to be prepared before running them.

#### i. Clone the Iteration Zero git repository

The [ibm-garage-iteration-zero](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/ibm-garage-iteration-zero) repository contains a 
number of scripts that support the administrative tasks. It also has contains the Terraform scripts for installing 
the <Globals name="shortName" /> <Globals name="env" />.)

```shell script
git clone git@github.com:ibm-garage-cloud/ibm-garage-iteration-zero.git
cd ibm-garage-iteration-zero
```

#### ii. Log in to <Globals name="ic" /> using the <Globals name="iccli" />

```shell script
ibmcloud login -a cloud.ibm.com -r <region>
```

### B. Upgrade the image registry

Upgrade the service plan for the [image registry](/guides/image-registry) so that is has unlimited capacity for images.

```shell script
ibmcloud cr plan-upgrade standard
```

<InlineNotification>

**Note**: The steps below need to be repeated for each new <Globals name="env" />:
- Each environment needs its own resource group and pair of access groups for administrators and users.
- Each environment will need its own cluster, whether it's created by an account manager or an environment administrator.

</InlineNotification>

### C. Create the resource group

[Create or provide a resource group](https://cloud.ibm.com/account/resource-groups). The resource group 
should be given a name that clearly identifies the purpose and usage of the collection
of resources, such as the development team, the project, the environment, and/or the application(s) implemented. For
example, we give our resource groups names like `mooc-team-one`, `garage-dev-tools`, `cntk-showcase`, etc.

<InlineNotification kind="warning">

**Warning**: **The resource group name should be 24 characters or fewer, and should conform to 
[Kubernetes resource naming conventions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names)** 
-- the name should be all lowercase letters, digits, and the separators should be dashes. 
(Unless otherwise specified, the installation scripts will name the cluster `<resource-group>-cluster`
 and a cluster name is limited to 32 characters.)

</InlineNotification>

### C. Create an <Globals name="ic" /> API Key

An API Key is used to authenticate to the <Globals name="ic" /> APIs. It is specific to a user within a particular 
account, meaning you need a different API key for each account you will be accessing. 

**Note:** If you will be using classic
infrastructure and/or multiple `account mangers` follow these instructions instead to create a 
[functional ID](/admin/plan-installation#create-a-functional-id-for-classic-infrastructure-permissions) for the
account.

[Create an API key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-userapikey#create_user_key) and 
download each key to a file. Be sure to include a descriptive name of the APIKey.

### D. Attach the <Globals name="ic" /> API Key to the resource group

To create resources in the resource group, the account will need API keys for the container service 
to [create resources in the classic infrastructure](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-access_reference#infra). 
The API key is needed for each region and resource group. Use the API key from the previous step for these steps:

1. Log into the IBM Cloud CLI [using the functional ID key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-federated_id#api_key) created by the account owner
    ```shell script
    ibmcloud login --apikey @key_file_name
    ```
2. Reset the API key for a given region for the container service: [Setting up the API key to enable access to the infrastructure portfolio](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#api_key)
    ```shell script
    ibmcloud ks api-key reset --region <region>
    ```
3. The [list of existing API keys](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys) shows the new key named `containers-kubernetes-key`; the description specifies the resource group and region

### E. Create access groups for the resource group

For each resource group, create an access group for `environment administrators` and `environment users`. The access 
group can be configured manually or with a script provided in the `ibm-cloud-iteration-zero` repository.

#### i. Create the access group for environment administrators

1. Create a new [access group](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-account_setup) named something like
 `<resource_group>-ADMIN` (all capital letters)
2. Run the script `./terraform/scripts/acp-admin.sh` from the `ibm-garage-iteration-zero` repository to add the necessary policies to the access group
    ```shell script
    ./terraform/scripts/acp-admin.sh {ACCESS_GROUP} {resource group}
    ```
3. Add the environment administrator(s) to the group

<br />

The script adds policies that allow the user to add resources to the resource group:
- Permission to create clusters
- Permission to manage the IBM Cloud Container Registry (used as the environment's [image registry](/guides/image-registry))
- Permission to create service instances

#### ii. Create the access group for environment users

1. Create a new [access group](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-account_setup) named something like 
`<resource_group>-USER` (all capital letters)
2. Run the script `./terraform/scripts/acp-user.sh` from the `ibm-garage-iteration-zero` repository to add the necessary policies to the access group
    ```shell script
    ./terraform/scripts/acp-admin.sh {ACCESS_GROUP} {resource group}
    ```
3. Add the users to the group

<br />

The script adds policies that allow the user to use resources to the resource group:
- Access to the resource group
- Access to the cluster
- Access to the image registry
- Access to each of the services in the resource group

### F. (Optional) Create the cluster

The Toolkit install scripts can provision a cluster during the install process. However, if the user running the 
install scripts doesn't have permission to create the cluster or if you just want to separate the process of provisioning
the cluster and installing the tools then the cluster can be created in advance.

The process supports either a Kubernetes cluster or Red Hat OpenShift cluster. A typical cluster has 3 nodes, each 
with 8 vCPUs and 32GB RAM.

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="3. (Optional) Set up Classic Infrastructure">

Virtual Private Cloud infrastructure is recommended for use with clusters as it easier to manage with IAM and provides
a superior environment. However, there are some situations where classic infrastructure is still required, particularly
Cloud Paks. When classic infrastructure will be used then the following additional configuration is required.

### A. Create a functional ID for Classic Infrastructure permissions

Account managers need the permissions to create and manage IaaS resources required by a <Globals name="env" />. 
Permissions for classic infrastructure (formerly known as SoftLayer) cannot be added to an access group, only to a user. Rather than 
add these permissions to each account manager, create a [functional ID](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-manapikey#ibm-cloud-api-keys) 
and grant it the infrastructure permissions. 

The functional ID will [own the API keys](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-users#api_key_most_cases) 
that the Kubernetes service needs to create clusters. As account managers are added to and removed from the account, the 
functional ID will always remain and always have the necessary infrastructure permissions.

#### i. Set up the functional ID in the account

1. Create the email account for the functional ID, sign it up for an IBM Cloud account, and 
[invite the functional ID](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-iamuserinv) to this account.
2. Run the script `./terraform/scripts/acp-iaas.sh` from the `ibm-garage-iteration-zero` repository to grant the necessary
permissions to the functional ID user.

```shell script
./terraform/scripts/acp-iaas.sh {functional-id}
```

<br />

The script adds the [classic infrastructure permissions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-access_reference#infra) 
needed to create and manage clusters:
- Create VLANs
- Create Kubernetes Service clusters (e.g. create virtual servers, storage, and networking)
- Manage Kubernetes Service clusters (e.g. add nodes)

<br />

The script also adds the IAM permissions to:
- Run the command to reset the API key that the Kubernetes service will use

<br />

By granting these infrastructure permissions to the functional ID and using it to create API keys, the account managers 
and environment administrators can create Kubernetes and OpenShift clusters without needing infrastructure permissions.

#### ii. Create API keys for the functional ID

Each account manager will need to use an API Key owned by functional ID's to have the necessary permissions to provision
the classic infrastructure for the cluster. For security reasons, each account manager needs their own API key for the 
functional ID's account.

1. Log into IBM Cloud as the functional ID (not as the account owner) and switch to the appropriate account.
2. For each account manager, [create an API key](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/iam?topic=iam-userapikey#create_user_key) and 
download each key to a file. Be sure to include the account manager's name in the name/description of the APIKey.
3. Give each account manager their API key file for the functional ID

<br />

Users should not share these API key files with each other. When a user is no longer an account manager, remove them 
from the access group and delete their API key.

### B. Public and private VLANs

Create or provide a pair of public and private VLANs for the selected region and zone. These VLANs will implement the 
public and private networks in the Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster. Use following to find the available 
[<Globals name="ic" /> locations](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-zero-downtime#ov_intro_reg "Locations for resource deployment")
and the available [data centers](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/overview?topic=overview-zero-downtime#data_center) 
in each region, such as *dal10* or *lon02*

<InlineNotification>

Note: If your account already has a pair of VLANs for your desired region and zone, you can use those.

</InlineNotification>

#### Create and manage vlans

Visit the [VLANs](https://cloud.ibm.com/classic/network/vlans) page to list and manage the VLANs. Select `Order VLAN` to
create a new public or private VLAN for use with the cluster.

#### List the available vlans

Use the [IGC CLI](/getting-started/cli)'s `igc vlan` command to select two existing VLANs and generate the properties 
to use for the installation scripts

```shell script
igc vlan
```

<br />

These links help explain how to find the VLANs an account has, create more, and how a cluster uses them to implement its 
network:
- [Getting started with VLANs](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/infrastructure/vlans)
- [Understanding network basics of classic clusters](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-plan_clusters#plan_basics)
- [Overview of classic networking in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-subnets#basics)
- List and create VLANs: [Resources > Classic Infrastructure > IP Management > VLANs](https://cloud.ibm.com/classic/network/vlans)

</AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

With these steps completed, the account manager will have configured the account so that the environment administrator 
can install the environment. As you move into the next step of installing into the environment that has just been
prepared, be sure to record the following information:

- <Globals name="ic" /> API key
- Resource group name
- Region
- Data center (classic infrastructure only)
- Private VLAN id (classic infrastructure only)
- Public VLAN id (classic infrastructure only)
