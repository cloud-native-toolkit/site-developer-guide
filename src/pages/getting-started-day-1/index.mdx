import Globals from 'gatsby-theme-carbon/src/templates/Globals';

If you already have access to a development cluster that has been set up with the Toolkit you can get started 
deploying an application to the cluster with an Enterprise-grade devops pipeline. While you
are there, you can also explore the <Globals name="shortName" /> Developer Dashboard and/or the OpenShift console
to learn how to leverage those resources to increase productivity building cloud-native applications.
