title: Developer Tools Setup
---

To enable the best working experience through the hands-on exercises, you
need to select the environment you plan to use for development and the required tools for integration with IBM Cloud.

- If you plan to use your desktop/laptop for hands-on exercises, follow
 the instructions in the Desktop/Laptop tab. You will need a recent macOS or
  Windows 10 operating system for this option.
- If you cannot install tools on your desktop/laptop, follow the Cloud Shell
 instructions.

Once you have fulfilled these setup requirements you will be ready to
go through the **Getting Started** steps.

## Introduction to Cloud Shell

IBM Cloud Shell is a free service that gives you complete control of your cloud resources, applications, and 
infrastructure, from any web browser. It's instantly accessible from your free IBM Cloud account--no other installation 
is needed.

Features of IBM Cloud Shell include:

- Preconfigured environment: IBM Cloud Shell provides a curated, cloud-based workspace with dozens of preinstalled tools 
  and programming languages. It's automatically authenticated with your IBM Cloud account so you can start to develop 
  immediately.

- File upload/download: use this feature to import files to IBM Cloud Shell or pull-down data to your local machine.

- Multiple sessions: use up to five shell sessions at a time to maximize your productivity. Mirror workflows on your 
  local machine, or view logs on one session while editing a file in another.

### Cloud Shell setup
- Open the IBM Cloud console (cloud.ibm.com) in your browser and log in if needed.

- Invoke Cloud Shell by clicking on the button at the top, right-hand corner of the browser window.

- Set up `igc` by running the following commands on the just opened terminal:
    ```shell
    curl -sL shell.cloudnativetoolkit.dev | sh - && . ~/.bashrc
    ```

- If successful, you should see something like the following:
    ```shell
    Downloading scripts: https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/cloud-shell-commands/releases/download/0.3.5/assets.tar.gz
    ** Installing argocd cli
    ** Installing tkn cli
    ** Installing kube-ps1
    ** Installing icc
    ** Installing Cloud-Native Toolkit cli
       + Installing igc cli
    ```

-  You can check the CLI tools package was installed correctly by checking the `oc` version:
    ```shell
    $ oc sync --version
    1.0.1
    ```
