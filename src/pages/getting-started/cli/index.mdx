The <Globals name="shortName" /> Command Line Interface (CLI)

</PageDescription>

The <Globals name="longName" /> includes the IBM Garage for Cloud (IGC) Command Line Interface (CLI). The [<Globals name="igccli" />](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/ibm-garage-cloud-cli) provides a set of helpful utilities that can be invoked from the command line. The main objective is to make complicated CLI tasks and `YAML`,`configMap`, and `secret` configuration easier for a developer.

These utilities include:
- Register your application's git repo into a CI pipeline ([Jenkins](/guides/continuous-integration), [Tekton](/guides/continuous-integration-tekton), etc.)
- List the ingress URLs for the tools installed in the environment
- List the user names and passwords for the tools installed in the environment
- Build and deploy images to the environment using the IBM Cloud Image Registry
- Help copy `configMaps` and `secrets` into new projects/namespace in Kubernetes or OpenShift
- Enable existing <Globals name="templates" /> with the necessary artifacts to be integrated easily into the <Globals name="env" />

You can either install the CLI onto your computer or install the Cloud Shell Commands environment.

## Use the CLI

<InlineNotification>

To use the <Globals name="igccli" />, first install the [prerequisite tools](/getting-started/prereqs), which include:
- The <Globals name="ic" /> CLI
- The <Globals name="kube" /> CLI
- The <Globals name="ocp" /> CLI

</InlineNotification>

To use the <Globals name="igccli" />, you must be logged into your <Globals name="ic" /> account and cluster.

- Log into your <Globals name="ic" /> account with the correct region and resource group:
    ```bash
    ibmcloud login -a cloud.ibm.com -r <region> -g <resource group>
    ```

- Log into your cluster:

<Accordion>

<AccordionItem title="Kubernetes">

```bash
ibmcloud ks cluster config --cluster <CLUSTER>
```

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="OpenShift">

```bash
oc login --server=<url> --token=<apikey>
```
</AccordionItem>

</Accordion>

Once logged in, you can use the CLI commands.

- For example, this command lists the dashboard ingress URLs for all of the install tools in the tools namespace:
    ```bash
    igc endpoints -n tools
    ```

## Available commands

### vlan

Lists the `vlans` for a particular `resource group` and `region`. The command
expects that an `ibmcloud login` has already been performed to set up the
environment. This information is useful for preparing Terraform cluster creation steps

### credentials

Prints the urls and credentials for the tools deployed into the cluster.
This includes Jenkins, Argo CD, and SonarQube, Pact, Artifactory.

### ingress

Lists the ingress urls for the provided namespace. If no namespace
is provided, `dev` is used.

### namespace

Creates a new namespace/project in your cluster and copies the necessary `configMaps` and `secrets` from the `tools` namespace.
This enables new pipelines to be registered and run and for them to have access to all the essential data needed to access the tools and the <Globals name="ic" /> platfrom.

```bash
igc namespace dev-team-a
```

### pipeline

Registers a git repository project as a Jenkins pipeline by creating a Kubernetes secret to hold
the Git authentication information, calling the Jenkins API, and creating a web-hook.
This command is intended to be run within the repository directory of a project for
which a pipeline should be generated. You can supply a new namespace for your pipeline

```
igc pipeline -n dev-team-a
```


The pipeline command supports both `jenkins` and `tekton` pipelines using the flags `--jenkins` or `--tekton`,
respectively.  Jenkins is the default if no value is provided.

```
igc pipeline -n dev-team-a --tekton
```

### tools

Launches the `ibm-garage-cli-tools` docker image in an interactive
terminal. This image provides commonly used infrastructure tools like,
`terraform`, `kubectl`, `oc` etc.

### enable

"Enables" an existing project with the DevOps artifacts. The CLI reads the
 list of
 available pipelines and applies the selected pipeline to your code repo. This
  command is
  intended to be run within a git repository directory of a project for
which a pipeline should be enabled.
```bash
igc enable
```

Once the project has been enabled you will need to run `igc pipeline` to
 register the git repo as a pipeline with your target development cluster.

The `enable` command adds a number of files to the local filesystem, including but not limited to:

- Helm chart
- Dockerfile
- Jenkinsfile

After `enable` is called, the generated files should be committed and pushed to the git repository.

The default pipeline repo is `https://ibm-garage-cloud.github.io/garage-pipelines/`, but a different one can be used by providing the `--repo` argument.  The source for the provided pipeline repo can be found at `https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/garage-pipelines` to use as a template.
