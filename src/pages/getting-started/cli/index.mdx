The <Globals name="shortName" /> Command Line Interface (CLI)

</PageDescription>

The <Globals name="longName" /> includes the IBM Garage for Cloud (IGC) Command Line Interface (CLI). The [<Globals name="igccli" />](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/ibm-garage-cloud-cli) provides a set of helpful utilities that can be invoked from the command line. The main objective is to make complicated CLI tasks and `YAML`,`configMap`, and `secret` configuration easier for a developer.

These utilities include:
- Register your application's git repo into a CI pipeline ([Jenkins](/guides/continuous-integration), [Tekton](/guides/continuous-integration-tekton), etc.)
- List the ingress URLs for the tools installed in the environment
- List the user names and passwords for the tools installed in the environment
- Build and deploy images to the environment using the IBM Cloud Image Registry
- Help copy `configMaps` and `secrets` into new projects/namespace in Kubernetes or OpenShift
- Enable existing <Globals name="templates" /> with the necessary artifacts to be integrated easily into the <Globals name="env" />

You can either install the CLI onto your computer or install the Cloud Shell Commands environment.

## Use the CLI

<InlineNotification>

To use the <Globals name="igccli" />, first install the [prerequisite tools](/getting-started/prereqs), which include:
- The <Globals name="ic" /> CLI
- The <Globals name="kube" /> CLI
- The <Globals name="ocp" /> CLI

</InlineNotification>

To use the <Globals name="igccli" />, most commands require that you be logged into your <Globals name="ic" /> account and cluster.

- Log into your <Globals name="ic" /> account with the correct region and resource group:
    ```bash
    ibmcloud login -a cloud.ibm.com -r <region> -g <resource group>
    ```

- Log into your cluster:

<Accordion>

<AccordionItem title="Kubernetes">

```bash
ibmcloud ks cluster config --cluster <CLUSTER>
```

</AccordionItem>

<AccordionItem title="OpenShift">

```bash
oc login --server=<url> --token=<apikey>
```
</AccordionItem>

</Accordion>

Once logged in, you can use the CLI commands.

- For example, this command lists the dashboard ingress URLs for all of the tools installed in the `tools` namespace:
    ```bash
    igc endpoints -n tools
    ```

## Available commands

### vlan

Lists the VLANs for a particular IBM Cloud region. This information is useful for preparing Terraform cluster creation steps.

This command requires that the terminal is already logged in to the cloud region. It does NOT need to be logged in to a cluster.

**Example usage**

- List a pair of public/private VLANs for a new environment to use

    ```bash
    igc vlan
    ```

### dashboard

Opens the [Developer Dashboard](/getting-started/dashboard) in the default browser. If a default browser has not been configured, then the URL to the Dashboard will be printed out.

The dashboard is deployed in a namespace and displays the tools deployed in the same namesapce, as listed by the `credentials` command. Additional tools can be deployed to the namespace; then use the `tool-config` command to add a tool to the list of credentials and add a panel to the dashboard.

This command requires that the terminal is already logged in to the cluster.

**Command flags**
- `-n` -- The namespace where the dashboard has been deployed; the default is `tools`

**Example usage**

- Open the dashboard in the default browser

    ```bash
    igc dashboard
    ```

### credentials

Lists the endpoints and credentials for the tools running in the environment. The tools reported include Jenkins, SonarQube, ArgoCD, etc.

This command requires that the terminal is already logged in to the cluster.

**Command flags**
- `-n` -- The namespace where the tools have been deployed; the default is `tools`

**Example usage**

- List the credentials for the tools installed in the `tools` namespace

    ```bash
    igc credentials -n my-namespace
    ```

    The credentials output is a JSON doc like this

    ```bash
    $ igc credentials
    Credentials:  {
      argocd: {
        user: 'admin',
        password: '12345678',
        url: 'https://argocd-tools.mycluster.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud'
      },
      . . .
      dashboard: {
        url: 'https://dashboard-tools.mycluster.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud'
      },
      . . .
    }
    ```

### tool-config

Configures a new tool in the environment. After deploying the tool, use this command to add the tool to the list of credentials so that it will be displayed in the dashboard.

**Command flags**
- The name for the tool
- `-n` -- The tools namespace; the default is `tools`
- `--url` -- The endpoint for accessing the tool, usually its dashboard
- `--username` -- (Optional) The user name for logging into to tool
- `--password` -- (Optional) The password for logging into to tool

**Example usage**

- Configure a tool named `my-tool` with its dashboard's endpoint and credentials

    ```bash
    igc tool-config my-tool --url https://mytool-dashboard.mycluster.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud --username admin --password password
    ```



### endpoints

Lists the ingress and/or route URLs for the applications in a namespace. The results are provided in an interactive menu. If one of the endpoints is selected, it will display the URL and launch it in the default browser. Selecting `Exit` will display the full list and exit.

This command requires that the terminal is already logged in to the cluster.

**Command flags**
- `-n` -- The deployment namespace; the default is `dev`

**Example usage**

- List the ingresses and route URLs for the apps running in the `tools` namespace

    ```bash
    igc endpoint -n tools
    ```

### namespace

Creates a Kubernetes namespace or OpenShift project (if it doesn't already exist) and adds the necessary data and tools to make it work well as part of the <Globals name="env" />.

This command requires that the terminal is already logged in to the cluster.

The command adds a service account to the namespace containing the pull secrets for pulling images from the [image registry](/guides/image-registry). This enables the namespace to deploy containers from the registry.

**Command flags**
- `-z` -- The name of the service account; the default is `default`

**Example usage**

- Create a namespace for performing testing, one that can deploy containers from the image registry

    ```bash
    igc namespace test
    ```

If the cluster is OpenShift, each build will be run in the developer's project, so this command copies the resources needed to run the build pipeline from a template project that already has these resources (certain config maps and secrets that the pipeline uses). The project can be set up to run Jenkins pipelines, Tekton pipelines, or both.

**Command flags**
- `-t` -- The template namespace; the default is `tools`
- `--jenkins` -- Install Jenkins into the namespace
- `--tekton` -- Copy the available Tasks and Pipelines from the template namespace

**Example usage**

- Create a namespace for building a Stock Trading app using Jenkins pipelines defined in the `tools` namespace

    ```bash
    igc namespace dev-stock --jenkins
    ```

### pipeline

Connects a branch in a Git repo to a CI pipeline in the <Globals name="env" /> and triggers an initial build. When a new commit is added to the branch, that triggers the pipeline to run, which will rebuild and redeploy the app using the new code. The Git repo needs to be hosted using a site that supports triggers such as GitHub or GitLab. The environment supports CI pipelines implemented using Tekton or Jenkins.

This command requires that the terminal is already logged in to the cluster. It also requires that the terminal's current directory is the repository directory for your local copy of the Git repo. The command will use the local Git repo's configuration to find the server copy.

The command will prompt for the username and personal access token to access the Git repository, unless those are provided as command-line parameters. It will also prompt you for the branch to use to trigger builds; the default is `master`.

**Command flags**
- `-n` -- The deployment namespace; the default is `dev`
- `-u` -- The username for accessing the Git repo
- `-p` -- The personal access token for accessing the Git repo
- `--jenkins` -- Deploy using a Jenkins pipeline; this is the default
- `--tekton` -- Deploy using a Tekton pipeline

**Example usage**

- Create a Jenkins pipeline in the `dev` namespace and prompt for the Git credentials

    ```bash
    igc pipeline --jenkins
    ```

- Create a Tekton pipeline in the `my-dev` namespace, using the Git credentials `gituser` and `gitpat`

    ```bash
    igc pipeline -n my-dev -u gituser -p gitpat --tekton
    ```

### enable

Adds DevOps artifacts to a Git repo that the <Globals name="env" /> uses to deploy the app. The command displays a list of available pipelines and applies the one you select to your code repo. The DevOps files added to your repo include (but are not limited to):

- Helm chart
- Jenkinsfile

This command DOES NOT require that the terminal is already logged in to an IBM Cloud account nor the cluster. It DOES require that the terminal's current directory is the repository directory for your local copy of the Git repo.

The command will add files to the local repo. You should commit these new files and push them to the server repo. Then run `igc pipeline` to connect your repo to a pipeline in the environment.

**Command flags**
- `--repo` -- The set of pipelines to choose from; the default is https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/garage-pipelines

**Example usage**

- Enable a project with artifacts

    ```bash
    igc enable
    ```
