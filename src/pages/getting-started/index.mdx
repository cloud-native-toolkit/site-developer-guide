## The Software Development Life-Cycle

The <Globals name="longName" /> supports the full Software Development Life-Cycle (SDLC). Often, we break the life-cycle
into three "days" to describe the distinct phases through the development process. These phases are often performed
iteratively, revisiting the activities of each "day" as more information is learned and new requirements are understood.
The following "Getting Started" sections walk through using the <Globals name="tinyName" /> through each phase of the
overall development life-cycle.

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding, be sure to walk through the [<Globals name="shortName" /> prerequisites](./getting-started/prereqs) and set up the
[<Globals name="shortName" /> developer environment](/getting-started/dev-env-setup). The developer environment setup will install a
number of tools that are essential for cloud-native provisioning, development, and operations.

### CLI overview

One of the components of the <Globals name="shortName" /> is the [<Globals name="igccli" />](./getting-started/cli) that provides a set
of commands to simplify common tasks that are performed often by all the personas during the cloud-native software
development life-cycle. The [<Globals name="igccli" />](./getting-started/cli) documentation aims to make known the various commands
that are available and de-mystify what actions it performs.
