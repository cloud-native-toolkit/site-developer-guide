## The Software Development Life-Cycle

The <Globals name="longName" /> supports the full Software Development Life-Cycle (SDLC). Often, we break the life-cycle
into three "days" to describe the distinct phases through the development process. The following "Getting Started" sections
walk through using the <Globals name="tinyName" /> through each phase of the overall development life-cycle:

<Row>
<Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterMdLeft>
<ArticleCard
    color="dark"
    title="Day 0 - Prepare"
    subTitle="Plan and create the environments that will be used for development and production, including the supporting tools"
    href="/getting-started-day-0"
    >

<Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterMdLeft>

    title="Day 1 - Build and deploy"
    subTitle="Get started developing applications using cloud-native practices and approaches to deliver code efficiently with quality from the start"
    href="/getting-started-day-1"

### Prerequisites

Before proceeding, be sure to install the [<Globals name="shortName" /> prerequisites](./prereqs). The prerequisites
contain a number of CLIs and tools that are essential for cloud-native provisioning, development, and operations.

### CLI overview

One of the components of the <Globals name="shortName" /> is the [<Globals name="igccli" />](./cli) that provides a set 
of commands to simplify common tasks that are performed often by all the personas during the cloud-native software
development life-cycle. The [<Globals name="igccli" />](./cli) documentation aims to make known the various commands
that are available and de-mystify what actions it performs.
