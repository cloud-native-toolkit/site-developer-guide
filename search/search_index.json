The instructions are provided here to understand what steps are required to manually integrate the Artifactory instance into the pipelines. Overview \u00b6 Artifactory is the environments's artifact repository manager . Before you can use it as part of the continuous integration pipeline, it first must be configured as part of the environment. Configuration \u00b6 Set up Artifactory in the environment with a Helm repository. Also, set up the environment to access Artifactory. Warning The version of Artifactory that is installed into the cluster is not configured for high availability. It is limited to the storage size of your cluster. It is highly recommended you integrate your pipelines with an enterprise grade Helm repository or artifact management system. Set up Artifactory \u00b6 Create a repository in Artifactory for storing Helm charts. Open the Artifactory dashboard from the Developer Dashboard and login Log into Artifactory using the default userid and password, igc credentials can show these values. The first time you log in the Welcome Page will prompt you to configure Artifactory using the Onboarding Wizard. Press Get Started The first step of the setup wizard is to change the default password. It is recommend you use a password generated by a password manager. 1Password is the tool IBM recommends to its employees. Save the password somewhere safe or in your password manager; you will need to manually update the password in the secret that is stored in the tools namespace/project called artifactory-access . There are more detailed instructions after you have completed the setup wizard. The next step is to define the base url that will be used by the server. From the browser you are currently using copy the URL from the address bar. Paste the URL into the Select Base URL form and remove any trailing context roots, similar to the one in this view. The next page in the wizard is the Configure a Proxy Server page. This is to setup a proxy for external resources. You can click Next to skip this step. The next page in the wizard is the Create Repositories page. Since the open source release of Artifactory doesn't provide a package for Helm repositories, we will use a generic repository to hold the helm artifacts.

In the Artifactory console, press the Welcome, admin menu button in the top right corner of the console and select Edit profile In the User Profile: admin page, enter you Artifactory password and press * Unlock Below, in the Authentication Settings section, is the Encrypted Password field. Press the Eye icon to view the encrypted password and press the Cut & Paste icon to copy it Now we have obtained the Encrypt key and had kept a copy of the Password we changed on the initial setup wizard. We need to update the secrets that stores these inside the cluster. Update the secret - OpenShift 4 \u00b6 In the OpenShift 4 console, go to Administrator > Workloads > Secrets . At the top, select the tools project and filter for artifactory . Select Edit Secret on artifactory-access . (You do not need to base encode these values the OpenShift console does this for you.) Update the values that you retrieved for the encrypt key and updated the admin password Add a key/value for ARTIFACTORY_ENCRYPT and set the value to your encrypt key value Update the ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD value with thew new admin password Click Save in OpenShift console View the secret in the console and confirm that the visible value of ARTIFACTORY_ENCRYPT matches the encrypted password shown in the Artifactory console On the command line, run igc credentials and verify that the Artifactory details have been updated Update the secret - Kubernetes and OpenShift 3 \u00b6 To update the secret in Kubernetes or Openshift 3, navigate to the secret called artifactory-access in the tools namespace and update the following values. You will need encode these value in base64 key before editing the secret. Kubernetes secrets store data in base64 format. So to store Artifactory's encrypted password in a secret, it needs to be encoded into base64. Any base64 encoding tool will work. For example: Go to the Base64 Encode website Paste the encrypted password into the online tool and press the Encode button In the field below, copy the encoded value into you clipboard or store it somewhere safe Find the ARTIFACTORY_ENCRYPT value (under data ) and paste in the Artifactory base64 key into the field Find the ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD value (under data ) and paste in the Rerun the Pipeline \u00b6 Previously, when you deployed you first app, the pipeline's Package Helm Chart stage didn't store the chart because the ARTIFACTORY_ENCRYPT property was not set.

Many of these secrets and config maps are also used by the pipeline scripts, so you may need to update them as you change passwords. Namespaces \u00b6 The Iteration Zero scripts create four namespaces that are used by the components deployed into the cluster: tools , dev , test , and staging . The actual names used for the namespaces are provided in Terraform variables with the defaults being those listed. The variables are then passed into the namespaces module in stage1-namespaces.tf . Provided resources \u00b6 TLS secret \u00b6 When the cluster is created, a secret containing the TLS certs for the ingress subdomain is provided in the default namespace. The the name of the secret is based off of the cluster name with some rules applied to limit the length and replace disallowed characters. Note To avoid issues with the naming conventions for the secret, the Iteration Zero scripts look for the secret that has a tls.key value: kubectl get secrets -o jsonpath='{.items[?(@.data.tls\\.key != \"\")].metadata.name}' . Ideally this would be identified using a label and a selector... During the Iteration Zero process, the TLS secret is copied into each of the four namespaces created and used by the Iteration Zero processes. Pull secrets \u00b6 Pull secrets for the IBM Cloud Image Registry are generated in the cluster as part of the Iteration Zero process to prepare the namespaces. The secrets are initially created in the default namespace with the following names: default-icr-io default-{region}-icr-io During the namespace preparation process, the pull secrets are copied into the different namespaces with default- prefix dropped. E.g. icr-io {region}-icr-io The pull secrets are also added to the default service account in each of the namespaces. As a result, it is not necessary to directly reference the pull secret as long as the pod runs under the default service account. Created resources \u00b6 The following resources are all created during the Iteration Zero provisioning process. These resources are used generally to expose the config of the installed tools but specifically used by the CI pipeline ( Jenkins , Tekton , etc.) to interact with the deployed tools. The resources are bound as optional environment variables in the containers used within the pipeline so if a particular tool has not been installed the associated environment variables won't be set. For example: envFrom : - configMapRef : name : pactbroker-config optional : true - configMapRef : name : sonarqube-config optional : true - secretRef : name : sonarqube-access optional : true IBM Cloud config \u00b6 The Iteration Zero script creates a config map and secret named ibmcloud-config and ibmcloud-access in the default namespace that contains the relevant configuration values for the cluster within the IBM Cloud account. The config map and secret are copied into each of the Iteration Zero namespaces as the namespaces are created. ibmcloud-config config map \u00b6 The following values are collected: CLUSTER_TYPE - the type of cluster (kubernetes or openshift) APIURL - the api url used to connect to the IBM Cloud environment SERVER_URL - the server url used to connect to the cluster, particularly for OpenShift RESOURCE_GROUP - the IBM Cloud resource group where the cluster has been installed REGISTRY_URL - the url to the image registry REGISTRY_NAMESPACE - the namespace within the image registry where images will be stored REGION - the IBM Cloud region where where the cluster has been installed CLUSTER_NAME - the name of the cluster INGRESS_SUBDOMAIN - the subdomain for the cluster to use in building ingress urls TLS_SECRET_NAME - the name of the secret that contains the TLS certificate information ibmcloud-access secret \u00b6 The following values are collected: APIKEY - the IBM Cloud apikey used to access the environment ArgoCD config \u00b6 argocd-config config map \u00b6 ARGOCD_URL - the url of the ArgoCD ingress argocd-access secret \u00b6 ARGOCD_PASSWORD - the password for the argocd user ARGOCD_USER - the user id of the argocd user Artifactory config \u00b6 artifactory-config config map \u00b6 ARTIFACTORY_URL - the url for the Artifactory ingress artifactory-access config map \u00b6 ARTIFACTORY_USER - the user name of the admin user ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD - the password for the admin user ARTIFACTORY_ENCRPT - the encrypted password for the admin user.

A preferred model for implementing continuous delivery is GitOps, where the desired state of the operational environment is defined in a source control repository (namely Git). What is continuous delivery \u00b6 Continuous delivery is the DevOps approach of frequently making new versions of an application's components available for deployment to a runtime environment. The process involves automation of the build and validation process and concludes with a new version of the application that is available for promotion to another environment. Continuous delivery is closely related to continuous deployment. The distinction is: Continuous delivery deploys an application when a user manually triggers deployment Continuous deployment deploys an application automatically when it is ready Typically, continuous deployment is an evolution of a continuous delivery process. An application is ready for deployment when it passes a set of tests that prove it doesn't contain any significant problems. Once these tests have been automated in a way that reliably verifies the application components then the deployment can be automated. Additionally, for continuous delivery it important to employ other best practices around moving and managing changes in an environment: blue-green deployments, shadow deployments, and feature toggles to name a few. Until these practices are in place and verified, it is best to stick with continuous delivery. As with most cloud-native practices, the move from continuous deployment to continuous delivery would not be done in a \"big bang\" but incrementally and as different application components are ready. What is GitOps \u00b6 GitOps is the operational pattern of using source code repositories (namely Git) as the source of truth for defining the configuration that makes up the desired state of the operational environment. Git repositories are used to declaratively represent the desired state of applications in deployment environments. GitOps takes advantage of several Git features: Git provides a versioned history of changes, listing what was changed and who made the change Change releases can be managed from a pull request, allowing multiple people to make changes but a select few to approve the changes Git provides access control mechanisms to limit who can change and view the configuration Git enables changes to be rolled back quickly if there is an issue with a new release Git supports multiple models for change management: Branches, Forks, GitFlow, etc Hosted git providers (like GitHub) provide a rich API that allows the different operations to be automated, if desired CI/CD integration \u00b6 For the full end-to-end build and delivery process, both the CI and CD pipelines are used. When working in a containerized environment such as Kubernetes or Red Hat OpenShift, the responsibilities between the two processes are clearly defined: The CI pipeline is responsible for building validating and packaging the \"raw materials\" (source code, deployment configuration, etc) into versioned, deployable artifacts (container images, helm charts, published artifacts, etc) The CD pipeline is responsible for applying the deployable artifacts into a particular target environment A change made to one of the source repositories triggers the CI process. The CI process builds, validates, and packages those changes into deployable artifacts that are stored in the image registry and artifact repository(ies). The last step of the CI process updates the GitOps repository with information about the updated artifacts. At a minimum this step stores updates the version number to the newly released versions of the artifacts but depending on the environment this step might also update the deployment configuration. Note It is also possible to trigger a process when a new image is available in the image registry or a new artifact is available to the artifact management system. In this case, the CI process could be split into two parts: 1) create the container image and artifacts, and 2) update the GitOps repo with the available artifacts. Changes to the GitOps repository trigger the CD pipeline to run In the CD pipeline, the configuration describing the desired state as defined in the GitOps repository is reconciled with the actual state of the environment and resources are created, updated, or destroyed as appropriate. Tools to support Continuous Delivery \u00b6 The practice of (CD) can be accomplished in different ways and with different tools. It is possible and certainly valid to use the same tool for both CI and CD (e.g. Tekton or Jenkins) with caution you enforce a clear separation between the two processes. Typically, that would result in two distinct pipelines to respond to changes that happen within the two different Git repositories - source repo and gitops repo.

The process involves automation of the build and validation process and concludes with a new version of the application that is available for promotion to another environment. Continuous delivery is closely related to continuous deployment. The distinction is: Continuous delivery deploys an application when a user manually triggers deployment Continuous deployment deploys an application automatically when it is ready Typically, continuous deployment is an evolution of a continuous delivery process. An application is ready for deployment when it passes a set of tests that prove it doesn't contain any significant problems. Once these tests have been automated in a way that reliably verifies the application components then the deployment can be automated. Additionally, for continuous delivery it important to employ other best practices around moving and managing changes in an environment: blue-green deployments, shadow deployments, and feature toggles to name a few. Until these practices are in place and verified, it is best to stick with continuous delivery. As with most cloud-native practices, the move from continuous deployment to continuous delivery would not be done in a \"big bang\" but incrementally and as different application components are ready.","title":"What is continuous delivery"},{"location":"adopting/best-practices/devops/#what-is-gitops","text":"GitOps is the operational pattern of using source code repositories (namely Git) as the source of truth for defining the configuration that makes up the desired state of the operational environment.

Configure IBM Cloud account \u00b6 The account must provide a few resources that will be needed to install and use the environment: A public/private pair of VLANs A resource group A pair of access groups for the admin and users These are the steps an account manager should perform to configure the account. Upgrade the image registry \u00b6 First, we'll upgrade the service plan for the image registry so that is has more capacity. Set the registry plan ibmcloud cr plan-upgrade standard Now we can store more container images. Prepare to run scripts \u00b6 Second, we'll use some scripts in the steps below to help create access groups. Here, we'll download the scripts and prepare to run them. (If you want to use the console to manually configure the access groups, you can skip this step.) Clone the Git repository with the scripts. (This repo also has the scripts for installing the environment.) Clone the ibm-garage-iteration-zero Git repository to your local filesystem git clone git@github.com:cloud-native-toolkit/ibm-garage-iteration-zero.git Switch to the cloned directory cd ibm-garage-iteration-zero The scripts need you to log into IBM Cloud first.

Log in to the IBM Cloud CLI ibmcloud login -a cloud.ibm.com -r <region> Note The steps below need to be repeated for each new environment: Each environment can be in a different data center. For each new environment, select the data center to host it and ensure it has a pair of public/private VLANs for the environment to use. Two environments in the same data center can share a pair of VLANs, or each can be given a separate pair of VLANs. Each environment needs its own resource group and pair of access groups for administrators and users. Each environment will need its own cluster, whether it's created by an account manager or an environment administrator. Data center \u00b6 Third, decide which IBM Cloud location will host the environment. That will be specified with two settings: Region -- A geography such as us-south or eu-gb Zone -- A data center in the region such as dal10 or lon02 Public and private VLANs \u00b6 Fourth, create or provide a pair of public and private VLANs for the selected region and zone. These VLANs will implement the public and private networks in the Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster. Note If your account already has a pair of VLANs for your desired region and zone, you can use those. Use the Toolkit CLI's igc vlan command to select two existing VLANs and generate the properties to use for the installation scripts These links help explain how to find the VLANs an account has, create more, and how a cluster uses them to implement its network.

This resource group will control access to the environment's cluster and service instances. This resource group should typically be named after the development team, its project, or the application it is implementing. Warning The resource group name should be 24 characters or fewer, and should conform to Kubernetes resource naming conventions --the name should be all lowercase letters, digits, and the separators should be dashes.

Do this by running a script, or by using the console to manually perform the steps in the script. Also, add the environment administrator(s) (who is the user who will run the scripts to create the environment) to this group. To create the access group for the environment administrators: Create a new access group , name it something like <resource_group>-ADMIN (all capital letters) Run the script ./terraform/scripts/acp-admin.sh , which adds the necessary policies to the access group Add the environment administrator(s) to the group The script adds policies that allow the user to add resources to the resource group: Permission to create clusters Permission to manage the IBM Cloud Container Registry (used as the environment's image registry ) Permission to create service instances Access group for environment users \u00b6 Eighth, create an access group to enable users (e.g. developers, data scientists, etc.) to access the resources in the environment. This can be done later, after the environment is created, either by running a script or using the console. Also, add the users who will use the environment (e.g. developers, etc.) to this group. To create the access group for the environment users: Create a new access group , name it something like <resource_group>-USER (all capital letters) Run the script ./terraform/scripts/acp-user.sh , which adds the necessary policies to the access group Add the users to the group The script adds policies that allow the user to use resources to the resource group: Access to the resource group Access to the cluster Access to the image registry Access to each of the services in the resource group Cluster for the environment (optional) \u00b6 Ninth, if the environment administrator will install the environment including creating a new cluster, then skip this step. However, if the environment administrator will install the environment into an existing cluster, then the account manager must create the cluster for the environment administrator. Create the cluster that the environment will be installed into. Create either a Kubernetes cluster or Red Hat OpenShift cluster as needed.

Roles \u00b6 An environment is installed and used by users acting in four roles: Account owner : The user who owns the account Account managers : Account owner or other users with account management permissions Environment administrators : Users in the account with permissions to create services in the environment's resource group Environment users : Users in the account with permissions to use existing services in the environment's resource group (e.g. developers, data scientists, etc.) The account owner must create the access group for account managers (see below). The account owner will: Create an ACCT-MGR-IAM-ADMIN access group using the acp-mgr script Add a functional ID, configured using the acp-iaas script, with API keys for the account managers Then, as described in Configure Account , the account managers can set up the resource groups and access groups needed to install and use the environments. For each environment, the account managers will: Create a resource group Create an access group named <resource_group>-ADMIN using the script acp-admin Create an access group named <resource_group>-USER using the script acp-user This diagram from [Resource Access Management]((../../resources/ibm-cloud/access-control.md#access-group-example){: target=_blank} shows the relationship of these access groups to a pair of development environments: The steps below help the account owner start configuring the account in this manner. Set up account managers \u00b6 The account owner may want to delegate the responsibilities for configuring the account for all of the development teams that want environments. Those users who are delegated to will need account management permissions. An easy way to manage who has these permissions is to create an access group with those policies and add those users to the group. An account only needs one of these account manager access groups, which will be used to support all environments in the account. In a new account, the account owner is the only user. Even after inviting other users, the account owner is initially the only user with the account management permissions needed to grant those permissions to other users. Therefore it is the account owner who must create the access group for account managers. !!!Note: The video in Resource Access Management > Configuration Process shows how to perform the steps in this process. Prepare to run scripts \u00b6 We'll use some scripts in the steps below to help create access groups. Here, we'll download the scripts and prepare to run them. (If you want to use the console to manually configure the access groups, you can skip this step.) Clone the Git repository with the scripts. (This repo also has the scripts for installing the environment.) Clone the ibm-garage-iteration-zero Git repository to your local filesystem git clone git@github.com:cloud-native-toolkit/ibm-garage-iteration-zero.git Switch to the cloned directory cd ibm-garage-iteration-zero The scripts need you to log into IBM Cloud first. In the terminal you'll use to run the scripts, log in to IBM Cloud. Log in to the IBM Cloud CLI ibmcloud login -a cloud.ibm.com -r <region> Access group for account managers \u00b6 The account owner must create an access group to grant the necessary permissions for managing the account. Do this by running a script, or by using the console to manually perform the steps in the script. Also, add the account manager(s) to this group. Note IBM Cloud has multiple account management services , in addition to IAM: Billing, License and entitlement, Support center, etc. An easy way to grant access to these individually is to create an access group for administering each: ACCT-MGR-BILLING-ADMIN, ACCT-MGR-LICENSE-ADMIN, ACCT-MGR-SUPPORT-ADMIN. The group created below only has IAM capabilities, so a good name for it is ACCT-MGR-IAM-ADMIN. To create the access group for the account managers: Create a new access group , name it something like ACCT-MGR-IAM-ADMIN (all capital letters) (or name it after your account) Run the script ./terraform/scripts/acp-mgr.sh , which adds the necessary policies to the access group Add the account managers to the group The script adds policies that allow the user to: Create resource groups Invite users to the account Create access groups The script also adds the same policies that an environment administrator has. But whereas an environment administrator can only manage the resources in one resource group, an account manager can manage the resources in all resource groups. This gives the account manager the ability in any resource group to: Create clusters Manage the IBM Cloud Container Registry (used as the environment's image registry ) Create service instances Functional ID for infrastructure permissions \u00b6 Account managers need the permissions to create and manage IaaS resources required by a environment. Permissions for classic infrastructure (fka SoftLayer) cannot be added to an access group, only to a user. Rather than add these permissions to each account manager, create a functional ID and grant it the infrastructure permissions. The functional ID will own the API keys that the Kubernetes service needs to create clusters. As account managers are added to and removed from the account, the functional ID will always remain and always have the necessary infrastructure permissions. Set up the functional ID in the account: Create the functional ID, sign it up for an IBM Cloud account, and invite the user to this account Run the script ./terraform/scripts/acp-iaas.sh for the functional ID's user, which adds the necessary permissions to the user The script adds the classic infrastructure permissions needed to create and manage clusters: Create VLANs Create Kubernetes Service clusters (e.g. create virtual servers, storage, and networking) Manage Kubernetes Service clusters (e.g. add nodes) The script also adds the IAM permissions to: Run the command to reset the API key that the Kubernetes service will use By granting these infrastructure permissions to the functional ID and using it to create API keys, the account managers and environment administrators can create Kubernetes and OpenShift clusters without needing infrastructure permissions. Next, each account manager will need to use the functional ID to reset the API key that the Kubernetes service will use. By using the functional ID, the API key will be owned by the functional ID instead of by the account manager. The account managers need a way to log in as the functional ID without all of them sharing the ID's password or a single API key. Thus each account manager needs their own API key for the functional ID's account. Create API keys for the functional ID: Log into IBM Cloud as the functional ID (not as the account owner) Switch to this account that you're configuring For each account manager, create an API key , downloading each key to a file Give each account manager their API key file for the functional ID Users should not share these API key files with each other. When a user is no longer an account manager, remove them from the access group and delete their API key. To make a user an account manager, add them to the access group and create an API key for them. Process \u00b6 The overall process: Configure account -- An account manager configures the account so that environments can be installed Install environment -- An environment administrator runs the Cloud-Native Toolkit scripts to create a environment Configure environment -- The environment administrator finishes setting up the newly installed environment Once the environment is set up, the environment users can start using it to develop applications. 1. Configure account \u00b6 First, before installing an environment, an account manager needs to configure the IBM Cloud account for the environment. See Configure Account for detailed instructions, which accomplish this: Upgrade the image registry Prepare to run scripts Select a region and zone Select a pair of public/private VLANs Create a resource group Set the Kubernetes service API key Create an access group for environment administrators Create an access group for environment users Optionally, create a cluster for the environment 2. Install environment \u00b6 Once the account manager has configured the account for installing an environment, the account manager and the environment administrator need to jointly decide how the environment administrator is going to install the environment. There are two options: Install including creating a new cluster : The environment administrator who performs this install needs permissions to create clusters as well as service instances. The script will run as this user to create the cluster, create the service instances, and install the CI/CD tools in the cluster. Install into an existing cluster : The account manager creates the cluster and then grants the environment administrator access to it. The environment administrator who performs this install needs permissions to create service instances but not to create clusters. The script will run as the environment administrator to create the service instances and install the CI/CD tools in the existing cluster. Note A third option is to install an environment in Red Hat CodeReady Containers . For this option, you're not installing in IBM Cloud, so you don't have to configure your IBM Cloud account. However, you do have to install CRC. 3. Configure environment \u00b6 After installing the environment, before giving the users access to the environment, the environment administrator needs to finish configuring it. See Configure Environment for detailed instructions, which accomplish this: Configure RBAC security in the cluster Test opening the Developer Dashboard Complete setup of LogDNA Complete setup of SysDig Test the pipeline by deploying a first app Complete setup of Artifactory Complete setup of Argo CD Rerun pipeline and confirm that the app's Helm chart is added to Artifactory Set up a GitOps repo to validate ArgoCD setup and configuration Conclusion \u00b6 Having configured the account, installed the environment, and configured the environment, the administrators have now completed an end-to-end installation of a environment. It is ready for a development team to begin using for application development.","title":"Installation planning"},{"location":"adopting/best-practices/ibm-cloud-account/plan-installation/#plan-installation","text":"Overall process for installing a environment","title":"Plan Installation"},{"location":"adopting/best-practices/ibm-cloud-account/plan-installation/#background","text":"To understand how the process is performed, keep these concepts in mind.","title":"Background"},{"location":"adopting/best-practices/ibm-cloud-account/plan-installation/#roles","text":"An environment is installed and used by users acting in four roles: Account owner : The user who owns the account Account managers : Account owner or other users with account management permissions Environment administrators : Users in the account with permissions to create services in the environment's resource group Environment users : Users in the account with permissions to use existing services in the environment's resource group (e.g. developers, data scientists, etc.) The account owner must create the access group for account managers (see below).

You can change the Title, Prefix, and Cloud Console links by adding the following environment variables to your deployment yaml. Customize the Dashboard's title from its default of \"IBM Cloud Garage\" The necessary set of environment variables isn't defined by default. You need to edit the YAML for the developer-dashboard deployment in the tools namespace to insert this set of variables. Edit the YAML for the /tools/deployments/developer-dashboard resource. In the spec.template.spec.containers section, in the resources for the container named developer-dashboard , add a new env resource to this container that defines these environment variables: env : - name : DASHBOARD_TITLE value : GSI Labs Sandbox - name : DASHBOARD_PREFIX value : IBM - name : CLOUD_TITLE value : Azure Console - name : CLOUD_URL value : https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/ - name : LINKS_URL value : http://<url>/data/links.json Then fill in the values you want to use, such as the name of your team and company Note The CLOUD_TITLE , CLOUD_URL , and LINKS_URL aren't needed when the platform is IBM Cloud You can also tailor the list of content that is displayed in the Activation tab and the Starter Kits tab by creating your own version of the links.json JSON file and host that somewhere accessible to you cluster's network. Adding tools \u00b6 You can add additional tools to the Developer Dashboard and to the Tools menu on the OpenShift console. The tools in the cluster are added automatically, but the tools outside the cluster must be added manually. You can also add tools for the Cloud Paks that you install in the environment, for CodeReady Workspaces (if you've installed that in the environment), etc. Adding tools to the Dashboard \u00b6 Use the Cloud Native Toolkit CLI to add tools to the dashboard. Use this syntax to add a tool: igc tool-config --name <name of tool> --url <url of tool> These are tools that every Environment has but that are hosted outside of the cluster. To add these to the Dashboard, run these commands and provide the URLs: igc tool-config --name ir --url { url image registry } igc tool-config --name logdna --url { url to LogDNA instance } igc tool-config --name sysdig --url { url to Sysdig instance } igc tool-config --name github --url { url to git org } If your Environment includes the Cloud Paks with these tools, add them to your Dashboard: igc tool-config --name ta --url { url to the Transformation Advisor } igc tool-config --name mcm --url { url to IBM CP4MCM } igc tool-config --name integration --url { url to CP4I instance } If you've installed CodeReady Workspaces in your Environment, add it to your Dashboard: igc tool-config --name codeready --url { url to the CRW instance } This table lists the tools that can be displayed.

The tools in the cluster are automatically added, but you need to add the tools outside of the cluster to specify their URLs. You can also extend the Tools menu to provide fast links to common tools you the development team will require. These tools links are common across the cluster. Edit the file called tools.yaml in the terraform/scripts folder. This file contains the Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) required to configure the menu items. Add custom links for github , logdna , and sysdig , and save the file. Run the terraform/scripts/config-console-tools script to apply the settings in tools.yaml . To do so: Make sure you are logged into your cluster from the command line and run the script, specifying your cluster's ingress subdomain. To find the ingress subdomain, go to the cluster overview page in the IBM Cloud console; it's something like resource-group-NNN-XXX.region.containers.appdomain.cloud . ./config-console-tools { cluster ingress subdomain } Optionally, you can extend the list of tools to include links to other tools. For example, here are two links to the Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management and the Cloud Pak for Integration. --- apiVersion : console.openshift.io/v1 kind : ConsoleLink metadata : name : toolkit-mcm spec : applicationMenu : imageURL : https://dashboard-tools.#CLUSTER_INGRESS_URL/tools/icon/mcm section : Cloud Native Toolkit href : https://icp-console.gsi-learning-ocp43-7ec5d722a0ab3f463fdc90eeb94dbc70-0000.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud/ location : ApplicationMenu text : Multi Cloud Manager --- apiVersion : console.openshift.io/v1 kind : ConsoleLink metadata : name : toolkit-integration spec : applicationMenu : imageURL : https://dashboard-tools.#CLUSTER_INGRESS_URL/tools/icon/integration section : Cloud Native Toolkit href : https://navigator-integration.gsi-ocp311-integration-7ec5d722a0ab3f463fdc90eeb94dbc70-0001.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud/ location : ApplicationMenu text : Integration Obtaining links to external tools \u00b6 To add external tools to the Dashboard and/or Tools menu, you need to know the links to those tools.

Typical values look like this: shell script vlan_datacenter=\"dal10\" public_vlan_id=\"2366011\" private_vlan_id=\"2366012\" You must set all of these specifically for your cluster. Use the values provided by the account manager. vlan_datacenter -- The zone in the region in which the cluster worker nodes will be provisioned public_vlan_id -- The public VLAN that the cluster will use private_vlan_id -- The private VLAN that the cluster will use Optional: Generate the VLAN properties \u00b6 The IGC CLI can be used to generate these settings, to make the configuration as simple as possible. If your account has numerous VLANs and you want your cluster to use specific ones, then skip this step and provide the values by hand. This tool is for users who don't know what these required settings should be and want a simple way to gather reasonable defaults for their particular account. Log in using the Target the region where the cluster will be provisioned with the shell script ibmcloud target -r {region} Run the VLAN command shell script igc vlan Copy the output values from the CLI Command into your vlan.tfvars files D. (Optional) Customize the installed components \u00b6 The terraform/stages directory contains the default set of stages that define the modules that will be applied to the environment. The stages can be customized to change the makeup of the environment that is provisioned by either removing or adding stages from/to the terraform/stages directory. Note The stages occasionally have dependencies on other stages (e.g. most all depend on the cluster module, many depend on the namespace module, etc.) so be aware of those dependencies as you start making changes. Dependencies are reflected in the module.{stage name} references in the stage variable list. The terraform/stages/catalog directory contains some optional stages that are prep-configured and can be dropped into the terraform/stages directory. Other modules are available from the Garage Terraform Modules catalog and can be added as stages to the directory as well. Since this is Terraform, any other Terraform scripts and modules can be added to the terraform/stages directory as desired. E. Run the installation \u00b6 Open a terminal to the ibm-garage-iteration-zero directory Launch a Developer Tools Docker container from which the Terraform scripts will be run ./launch.sh This will download the Cloud Garage Tools Docker image that contains all the necessary tools to execute Terraform scripts and exec shell into the running container. When the container starts it mounts the filesystem's ./terraform/ directory as /home/devops/src/ and loads the values from the credentials.properties file as environment variables. Apply the Terraform by running the provided runTerraform.sh script ./runTerraform.sh This script collects the values provided in the environment-ibmcloud.tfvars and the stages defined in the terraform/stages to build the Terraform workspace. Along the way it will prompt for a couple pieces of information. Type of installation: cluster This prompt can be skipped by providing --cluster as an argument to ./runTerraform.sh Handling of an old workspace (if applicable): keep or delete If you executed the script previously for the current cluster configuration and the workspace directory still exists then you will be prompted to either keep or delete the workspace directory. Keep the workspace directory if you want to use the state from the previous run as a starting point to either add or remove configuration. Delete the workspace if you want to start with a clean install of the Toolkit. This prompt can be skipped by providing --delete or --keep as an argument to ./runTerraform.sh Verify the installation configuration The script will verify some basic settings and prompt if you want to proceed. After you select Y (for yes), the Terraform Apply process will begin to create the infrastructure and services for your environment. This prompt can be skipped by providing --auto-approve as an argument to ./runTerraform.sh Creating a new cluster takes about 1.5 hours on average (but can also take considerably longer) and the rest of the process takes about 30 minutes. Troubleshooting \u00b6 If you find that the Terraform provisioning has failed, for Private Catalog delete the workspace and for Iteration Zero try re-running the runTerraform.sh script again. The state will be saved and Terraform will try and apply the configuration to match the desired end state. If you find that some of the services have failed to create in the time allocated, try the following with Iteration zero: Manually delete the service instances in your resource group Re-run the runTerraform.sh script with the --delete argument to clean up the state ./runTerraform.sh --delete","title":"Install IBM Cloud cluster Iteration Zero"},{"location":"adopting/setup/ibmcloud-iz-cluster/#provision-an-ibm-cloud-cluster-using-iteration-zero-scripts","text":"Information This installation method will provision the cluster if it doesn't already exist","title":"Provision an IBM Cloud cluster using Iteration Zero scripts"},{"location":"adopting/setup/ibmcloud-iz-cluster/#install-a-managed-cluster-and-the-cloud-native-toolkit-using-iteration-zero","text":"","title":"Install a managed cluster and the Cloud Native Toolkit using Iteration Zero"},{"location":"adopting/setup/ibmcloud-iz-cluster/#a-download-the-iteration-zero-scripts","text":"Clone the ibm-garage-iteration-zero Git repository to your local filesystem git clone git@github.com:cloud-native-toolkit/ibm-garage-iteration-zero.git","title":"A.

If you will be provisioning a cluster outside of IBM Cloud then you can jump to provision the cluster . 1. Set up account managers access group \u00b6 The account owner creates this access group for account managers and adds the functional ID for managing API keys. See IBM Cloud account management for the overview of the roles involved. An account only needs one of these account manager access groups, which will be used to support all environments in the account. In a new account, the account owner is the only user. Even after inviting other users, the account owner is initially the only user with the account management permissions needed to grant those permissions to other users. Therefore, it is the account owner who must create the access group for account managers. Note The video in Resource Access Management > Configuration Process shows how to perform the steps in this process. A. Prepare to run scripts \u00b6 We'll use some scripts in the steps below to help create access groups. Before using them, the scripts need to be downloaded and the environment needs to be prepared before running them. i. Clone the Iteration Zero git repository \u00b6 The ibm-garage-iteration-zero repository contains a number of scripts that support the administrative tasks. It also has contains the Terraform scripts for installing the Cloud-Native Toolkit environment.) git clone git@github.com:cloud-native-toolkit/ibm-garage-iteration-zero.git cd ibm-garage-iteration-zero ii. Log in to IBM Cloud using the IBM Cloud CLI \u00b6 ibmcloud login -a cloud.ibm.com -r <region> B. Create the access group for account managers \u00b6 The account owner must create an access group to grant the necessary permissions for managing the account. A script has been provided to automate the configuration of the policies. Note IBM Cloud has multiple account management services , in addition to IAM: Billing, License and entitlement, Support center, etc. An easy way to grant access to these individually is to create an access group for administering each: ACCT-MGR-BILLING-ADMIN , ACCT-MGR-LICENSE-ADMIN , ACCT-MGR-SUPPORT-ADMIN . The group created below only has IAM capabilities, so we suggest ACCT-MGR-IAM-ADMIN for its name. To create the access group for the account managers: Create a new access group and name it something like ACCT-MGR-IAM-ADMIN or name it after your account (use all capital letters) Run ./terraform/scripts/acp-mgr.sh from the ibm-garage-iteration-zero repository to add the necessary policies to the access group ./terraform/scripts/acp-mgr.sh ACCT-MGR-IAM-ADMIN Add the users to the access group The ./terraform/scripts/acp-mgr.sh script adds policies that allow the user to: Create resource groups Invite users to the account Create access groups and manage access group membership Create clusters across all resources groups in the account Create service instances across all resource groups in the account Manage the IBM Cloud Container Registry (used as the environment's image registry) 2. Configure the account \u00b6 The account must provide a few resources that will be needed to install and use the Cloud-Native Toolkit environment: Upgrade the image registry Create a resource group Create a pair of access groups for the admin and users A. Prepare to run scripts \u00b6 We'll use some scripts in the steps below to help create access groups. Before using them, the scripts need to be downloaded and the environment needs to be prepared before running them. i. Clone the Iteration Zero git repository \u00b6 The ibm-garage-iteration-zero repository contains a number of scripts that support the administrative tasks. It also has contains the Terraform scripts for installing the Cloud-Native Toolkit environment.) git clone git@github.com:cloud-native-toolkit/ibm-garage-iteration-zero.git cd ibm-garage-iteration-zero ii. Log in to IBM Cloud using the IBM Cloud CLI \u00b6 ibmcloud login -a cloud.ibm.com -r <region> B. Upgrade the image registry \u00b6 Upgrade the service plan for the image registry so that is has unlimited capacity for images. ibmcloud cr plan-upgrade standard Note The steps below need to be repeated for each new environment: Each environment needs its own resource group and pair of access groups for administrators and users. Each environment will need its own cluster, whether it's created by an account manager or an environment administrator. C. Create the resource group \u00b6 Create or provide a resource group . The resource group should be given a name that clearly identifies the purpose and usage of the collection of resources, such as the development team, the project, the environment, and/or the application(s) implemented. For example, we give our resource groups names like mooc-team-one , garage-dev-tools , cntk-showcase , etc. Warning The resource group name should be 24 characters or fewer, and should conform to Kubernetes resource naming conventions - the name should be all lowercase letters, digits, and the separators should be dashes. (Unless otherwise specified, the installation scripts will name the cluster <resource-group>-cluster and a cluster name is limited to 32 characters.) D. Create an IBM Cloud API Key \u00b6 An API Key is used to authenticate to the IBM Cloud APIs. It is specific to a user within a particular account, meaning you need a different API key for each account you will be accessing. Note: If you will be using classic infrastructure and/or multiple account mangers follow these instructions instead to create a functional ID for the account. Create an API key and download each key to a file. Be sure to include a descriptive name of the APIKey. E. Attach the IBM Cloud API Key to the resource group \u00b6 To create resources in the resource group, the account will need API keys for the container service to create resources in the classic infrastructure . The API key is needed for each region and resource group. Use the API key from the previous step for these steps: Log into the IBM Cloud CLI using the functional ID key created by the account owner ibmcloud login --apikey @key_file_name Reset the API key for a given region for the container service: Setting up the API key to enable access to the infrastructure portfolio ibmcloud ks api-key reset --region <region> The list of existing API keys shows the new key named containers-kubernetes-key ; the description specifies the resource group and region F. Create access groups for the resource group \u00b6 For each resource group, create an access group for environment administrators and environment users . The access group can be configured manually or with a script provided in the ibm-cloud-iteration-zero repository. i. Create the access group for environment administrators \u00b6 Create a new access group named something like <resource_group>-ADMIN (use all capital letters) Run the script ./terraform/scripts/acp-admin.sh from the ibm-garage-iteration-zero repository to add the necessary policies to the access group ./terraform/scripts/acp-admin.sh { ACCESS_GROUP } { resource group } Add the environment administrator(s) to the group The script adds policies that allow the user to add resources to the resource group: Permission to create clusters Permission to manage the IBM Cloud Container Registry (used as the environment's image registry ) Permission to create service instances ii. Create the access group for environment users \u00b6 Create a new access group named something like <resource_group>-USER (use all capital letters) Run the script ./terraform/scripts/acp-user.sh from the ibm-garage-iteration-zero repository to add the necessary policies to the access group ./terraform/scripts/acp-user.sh { ACCESS_GROUP } { resource group } Add the users to the group The script adds policies that allow the user to use resources to the resource group: Access to the resource group Access to the cluster Access to the image registry Access to each of the services in the resource group 3. Create the Private Catalog \u00b6 A. Create the catalog \u00b6 Log in to the IBM Cloud Console Click Manage->Catalogs from the top menu Click on Create Catalog In the Create a catalog dialog, provide the following values: name: the name of the catalog, for example Team Catalog description: (optional) a brief description of the purpose of the catalog products: select Start with no products resource group: click Update to change the default resource group for the catalog Click Create to complete the catalog creation B. Register the Cloud-Native Toolkit tiles in the catalog \u00b6 Note The following instructions depend on the jq command, which is installed as part of the Cloud-Native Toolkit CLI Download create-catalog-offering.sh from the latest Iteration Zero release and make the file executable LATEST_RELEASE = $( curl -sL https://api.github.com/repos/cloud-native-toolkit/ibm-garage-iteration-zero/releases/latest | jq -r '.tag_name' ) curl -OL \"https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/ibm-garage-iteration-zero/releases/download/ ${ LATEST_RELEASE } /create-catalog-offering.sh\" chmod +x create-catalog-offering.sh Run the create-catalog-offering.sh scripts passing in the API Key and the name of the catalog that you created in the previous step ./create-catalog-offering.sh { API_KEY } \"Team Catalog\" 4. (Optional) Set up Classic Infrastructure \u00b6 Virtual Private Cloud infrastructure is recommended for use with clusters as it easier to manage with IAM and provides a superior environment. However, there are some situations where classic infrastructure is still required, particularly when using Cloud Paks due to some current storage limitations with the VPC infrastructure. When classic infrastructure will be used then the following additional configuration is required. For a more in depth look at the differences between Classic and Virtual Private Cloud infrastructure, please refer the the IBM Cloud documentation A. Create a functional ID for Classic Infrastructure permissions \u00b6 Account managers need the permissions to create and manage IaaS resources required by a environment. Permissions for classic infrastructure (formerly known as SoftLayer) cannot be added to an access group, only to a user. Rather than add these permissions to each account manager, create a functional ID and grant it the infrastructure permissions. The functional ID will own the API keys that the Kubernetes service needs to create clusters. As account managers are added to and removed from the account, the functional ID will always remain and always have the necessary infrastructure permissions. i. Set up the functional ID in the account \u00b6 Create the email account for the functional ID, sign it up for an IBM Cloud account, and invite the functional ID to this account. Run the script ./terraform/scripts/acp-iaas.sh from the ibm-garage-iteration-zero repository to grant the necessary permissions to the functional ID user. ./terraform/scripts/acp-iaas.sh { functional-id } The script adds the classic infrastructure permissions needed to create and manage clusters: Create VLANs Create Kubernetes Service clusters (e.g. create virtual servers, storage, and networking) Manage Kubernetes Service clusters (e.g. add nodes) The script also adds the IAM permissions to: Run the command to reset the API key that the Kubernetes service will use By granting these infrastructure permissions to the functional ID and using it to create API keys, the account managers and environment administrators can create Kubernetes and OpenShift clusters without needing infrastructure permissions. ii. Create API keys for the functional ID \u00b6 Each account manager will need to use an API Key owned by functional ID's to have the necessary permissions to provision the classic infrastructure for the cluster. For security reasons, each account manager needs their own API key for the functional ID's account. Log into IBM Cloud as the functional ID (not as the account owner) and switch to the appropriate account. For each account manager, create an API key and download each key to a file. Be sure to include the account manager's name in the name/description of the APIKey. Give each account manager their API key file for the functional ID Users should not share these API key files with each other. When a user is no longer an account manager, remove them from the access group and delete their API key. B. Public and private VLANs \u00b6 Create or provide a pair of public and private VLANs for the selected region and zone. These VLANs will implement the public and private networks in the Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster. Use following to find the available IBM Cloud locations and the available data centers in each region, such as dal10 or lon02 Note If your account already has a pair of VLANs for your desired region and zone, you can use those. Create and manage vlans \u00b6 Visit the VLANs page to list and manage the VLANs. Select Order VLAN to create a new public or private VLAN for use with the cluster. List the available vlans \u00b6 Use the IGC CLI 's igc vlan command to select two existing VLANs and generate the properties to use for the installation scripts igc vlan These links help explain how to find the VLANs an account has, create more, and how a cluster uses them to implement its network: Getting started with VLANs Understanding network basics of classic clusters Overview of classic networking in IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service List and create VLANs: Resources > Classic Infrastructure > IP Management > VLANs Next steps \u00b6 With these steps completed, the account manager will have configured the account so that the environment administrator can install the environment. As you move into the next step of installing into the environment that has just been prepared, be sure to record the following information: IBM Cloud API key Resource group name Region Data center (classic infrastructure only) Private VLAN id (classic infrastructure only) Public VLAN id (classic infrastructure only) Please now select which installation method to use: Catalog tile Iteration Zero scripts","title":"Configuring IBM Cloud based setup"},{"location":"adopting/setup/ibmcloud-setup/#prepare-an-ibm-cloud-account","text":"IBM CloudPrepare the account for an installation of Cloud-Native Toolkit environment Note: If you already have a cluster then you can jump to install the toolkit .

If you want to customize the Toolkit installation, then use the full Iteration Zero scripts. Iteration Zero \u00b6 Steps to install the Cloud-Native Toolkit for running Openshift or Kubernetes clusters. A. Download the Iteration Zero scripts \u00b6 Clone the ibm-garage-iteration-zero Git repository to your local filesystem git clone git@github.com:cloud-native-toolkit/ibm-garage-iteration-zero.git B. Configure the credentials \u00b6 In a terminal, change to the ibm-garage-iteration-zero cloned directory cd ibm-garage-iteration-zero Copy the credentials.template file to a file named credentials.properties cp credentials.template credentials.properties Note credentials.properties is already listed in .gitignore to prevent the private credentials from being committed to the git repository If on IBM Cloud, update the value for the ibmcloud.api.key property in credentials.properties with your IBM Cloud API key C. Configure the Environment Variables \u00b6 IBM Cloud A. Set Environment Variables \u00b6 The settings for creating the on are set in the environment-ibmcloud.tfvars file in the ./terraform/settings directory of the ibm-garage-iteration-zero repository. There are a number of values that can be applied in the file, some required and some optional. Consult with the following table to determine which values should be used: Variable Required? Description eg. Value cluster_type yes The type of cluster into which the toolkit will be installed kubernetes , ocp3 , ocp4 or ocp44 cluster_exists yes Flag indicating if the cluster already exists. ( false means the cluster should be provisioned) true resource_group_name yes Existing resource group in the account where the cluster has been created dev-team-one vpc_cluster yes Flag indicating that the cluster has been built on VPC infrastructure. Defaults to true true or false name_prefix no The prefix that should be applied for any resources that are provisioned. Defaults to {resource_group_name} dev-one region no The region where the cluster has been/will be provisioned us-east , eu-gb , etc vpc_zone_names no A comma-separated list of the VPC zones that should be used for worker nodes. This value is required if cluster_exists is set to false and vpc_cluster is set to true us-south-1 or us-east-1,us-east-2 cluster_name no The name of the cluster (If cluster_exists is set to true then this name should match an existing cluster). Defaults to {prefix_name}-cluster or {resource_group_name}-cluster dev-team-one-iks-117-vpc registry_namespace no The namespace that should be used in the IBM Container Registry. Defaults to {resource_group_name} dev-team-one-registry-2020 provision_logdna no Flag indicating that a new instance of LogDNA should be provisioned. Defaults to false true or false logdna_name no The name of the LogDNA instance (If provision_logdna is set to false this value is used by the scripts to bind the existing LogDNA instance to the cluster) cntk-showcase-logdna provision_sysdig no Flag indicating that a new instance of Sysdig should be provisioned. Defaults to false true or false sysdig_name no The name of the Sysdig instance (If provision_sysdig is set to false this value is used by the scripts to bind the existing Sysdig instance to the cluster) cntk-showcase-sysdig B. Configure the VLAN settings \u00b6 The vlan.tfvars file in terraform/settings contains properties that define the classic infrastructure configuration in order to provision a new cluster. Typical values look like this: shell script vlan_datacenter=\"dal10\" public_vlan_id=\"2366011\" private_vlan_id=\"2366012\" You must set all of these specifically for your cluster. Use the values provided by the account manager. vlan_datacenter -- The zone in the region in which the cluster worker nodes will be provisioned public_vlan_id -- The public VLAN that the cluster will use private_vlan_id -- The private VLAN that the cluster will use Optional: Generate the VLAN properties \u00b6 The IGC CLI can be used to generate these settings, to make the configuration as simple as possible. If your account has numerous VLANs and you want your cluster to use specific ones, then skip this step and provide the values by hand. This tool is for users who don't know what these required settings should be and want a simple way to gather reasonable defaults for their particular account. Log in using the Target the region where the cluster will be provisioned with the shell script ibmcloud target -r {region} Run the VLAN command shell script igc vlan Copy the output values from the CLI Command into your vlan.tfvars files C. (Optional) Customize the installed components \u00b6 The terraform/stages directory contains the default set of stages that define the modules that will be applied to the environment. The stages can be customized to change the makeup of the environment that is provisioned by either removing or adding stages from/to the terraform/stages directory. Note: The stages occasionally have dependencies on other stages (e.g. most all depend on the cluster module, many depend on the namespace module, etc.) so be aware of those dependencies as you start making changes. Dependencies are reflected in the module.{stage name} references in the stage variable list. The terraform/stages/catalog directory contains some optional stages that are prep-configured and can be dropped into the terraform/stages directory. Other modules are available from the Garage Terraform Modules catalog and can be added as stages to the directory as well. Since this is Terraform, any other Terraform scripts and modules can be added to the terraform/stages directory as desired. Multi-Cloud A. Set Environment Variables \u00b6 The configuration values for provisioning the environment on an existing OpenShift cluster are set in the environment-ocp.tfvars file in the ./terraform/settings directory of the ibm-garage-iteration-zero repository. There are only two values available: Variable Required? Description eg. Value server_url yes The url of the OpenShift cluster's API server https://api.mycluster.com cluster_name no The name of the cluster used simply for identification purposes. Defaults to ocp-cluster dev-team-one-ocp44 B. (Optional) Customize the installed components \u00b6 The terraform/stages-ocp4 directory contains the default set of stages that define the modules that will be applied to the environment. The stages can be customized to change the makeup of the environment that is provisioned by either removing or adding stages from/to the terraform/stages-ocp4 directory. Note: The stages occasionally have dependencies on other stages (e.g. most all depend on the cluster module, many depend on the namespace module, etc.) so be aware of those dependencies as you start making changes. Dependencies are reflected in the module.{stage name} references in the stage variable list. The terraform/stages-ocp4/catalog directory contains some optional stages that are prep-configured and can be dropped into the terraform/stages-ocp4 directory. Other modules are available from the Garage Terraform Modules catalog and can be added as stages to the directory as well. Since this is Terraform, any other Terraform scripts and modules can be added to the terraform/stages-ocp4 directory as desired. D. Run the installation \u00b6 Open a terminal to the ibm-garage-iteration-zero directory Launch a Developer Tools Docker container from which the Terraform scripts will be run ./launch.sh This will download the Cloud Garage Tools Docker image that contains all the necessary tools to execute Terraform scripts and exec shell into the running container. When the container starts it mounts the file system's ./terraform/ directory as /home/devops/src/ and loads the values from the credentials.properties file as environment variables. Apply the Terraform by running the provided runTerraform.sh script ./runTerraform.sh This script collects the values provided in the environment-ibmcloud.tfvars and the stages defined in the terraform/stages to build the Terraform workspace. Along the way it will prompt for a couple pieces of information. Type of installation: ibmcloud or ocp There are two major paths to installing with the Toolkit. In this case, we are installing into an IBM Cloud-managed environment so we will select ibmcloud . This prompt can be skipped by providing --ibmcloud as an argument to ./runTerraform.sh Handling of an old workspace (if applicable): keep or delete If you executed the script previously for the current cluster configuration and the workspace directory still exists then you will be prompted to either keep or delete the workspace directory. Keep the workspace directory if you want to use the state from the previous run as a starting point to either add or remove configuration. Delete the workspace if you want to start with a clean install of the Toolkit. This prompt can be skipped by providing --delete or --keep as an argument to ./runTerraform.sh Verify the installation configuration The script will verify some basic settings and prompt if you want to proceed. After you select Y (for yes), the Terraform Apply process will begin to create the infrastructure and services for your environment. This prompt can be skipped by providing --auto-approve as an argument to ./runTerraform.sh Creating a new cluster takes about 1.5 hours on average (but can also take considerably longer) and the rest of the process takes about 30 minutes.","title":"Install toolkit to existing cluster"},{"location":"adopting/setup/toolkit-install/#installing-to-toolkit-to-an-existing-cluster","text":"The fast-start install used in the learning setup is one option if you want a standard install.

Apply the Terraform by running the provided runTerraform.sh script ./runTerraform.sh This script collects the values provided in the environment-ibmcloud.tfvars and the stages defined in the terraform/stages to build the Terraform workspace. Along the way it will prompt for a couple pieces of information. Type of installation: ibmcloud or ocp There are two major paths to installing with the Toolkit. In this case, we are installing into an IBM Cloud-managed environment so we will select ibmcloud . This prompt can be skipped by providing --ibmcloud as an argument to ./runTerraform.sh Handling of an old workspace (if applicable): keep or delete If you executed the script previously for the current cluster configuration and the workspace directory still exists then you will be prompted to either keep or delete the workspace directory. Keep the workspace directory if you want to use the state from the previous run as a starting point to either add or remove configuration. Delete the workspace if you want to start with a clean install of the Toolkit. This prompt can be skipped by providing --delete or --keep as an argument to ./runTerraform.sh Verify the installation configuration The script will verify some basic settings and prompt if you want to proceed. After you select Y (for yes), the Terraform Apply process will begin to create the infrastructure and services for your environment.

The operator pipeline supports Ansible, Go, and Helm-based operators that have been built using the Operator SDK. The Cloud-Native Toolkit also provides a companion Tekton pipeline to build a custom Operator Lifecycle Manager catalog that simplifies deployment of the operators to a cluster. The following steps will walk you through using the pipelines to build an operator and operator catalog and deploy them to a cluster. Prerequisites \u00b6 Operator SDK \u00b6 The Tekton pipeline for building operators requires that the operator has been created by at least v1.0.0 of the Operator SDK but we recommend using the latest available (v1.3.0 at the time of this writing). The Operator SDK structure had a major architectural change with v1.0.0 and continues to have significant improvements made with each release. If you do not have operator-sdk , follow the installation instructions to get it. (Optional) Create your operator \u00b6 These steps will walk you through building a simple operator following the Operator SDK quick-start guide. You can choose between Ansible , Go , or Helm quick start guides for the following example. Note If you already have an operator built with v1.0.0+ of the Operator SDK then you can skip to the next section. The Ansible operator quick start seems to be the simplest way to get up and running quickly and exercise the Tekton pipelines. We've included the abbreviated steps from the Ansible quick start guide below. Create a directory for your operator and change to that directory mkdir memcached-operator cd memcached-operator Initialize the operator operator-sdk init --plugins = ansible --domain = example.com where: --plugins can be either ansible , go , or helm . If --plugins is not provided then it defaults to go --domain is the base domain name used for the Custom Resource Definition generated for the operator Create an API for the operator operator-sdk create api --group cache --version v1 --kind Memcached --generate-role where: - --group is the api group for the CRD - --kind is the resource kind for the CRD - --version is the resource version for the CRD Generate metadata for Operator bundle make bundle Answer the interactive questions Create the README.md and initialize git repository echo \"# memcached operator\" > README.md git init git add . git commit -m \"Initial commit\" Create a new remote git repository on a git server such as GitHub and copy the url Push the local git repository to the remote GitHub repository git remote add origin ${ GIT_URL } git push -u origin $( git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD ) At this point you have enough of a functioning operator to try out the Tekton operator pipeline. If you want to explore the operator you have created and/or enhance its capabilities, there are more detailed instructions on the operator sdk page. Register the operator pipeline \u00b6 This step is similar to what you learned in the fast-start Continuous Integration section deploying an application 1. Log into your Development Cluster from the command line \u00b6 Before starting, make sure you have set up your development tools . Cluster managed by IBM Cloud Log into the cluster with icc [cluster name|cluster nickname] OpenShift cluster Run oc login $SERVER -u $OCP_USERNAME -p $OCP_PASSWORD You should now be able to access the OpenShift console: oc console Info If your workshop is on Code Ready Workspaces, follow the steps in Code Ready Workspaces Setup before logging in to the cluster. The remaining steps assume this step has already been performed. If you stop and then come back later it is a good idea to re-run this step again before proceeding 2. Create the operator development namespace \u00b6 Before getting started, the development namespace/project needs to be created and prepared for the DevOps pipelines. This is something that would typically happen once at the beginning of a project when a development team is formed and assigned to the cluster. This step copies the common secrets and configMaps that contain the CI/CD configuration from the tools namespace into the development namespace/project. This enables the pipelines to reference the values easily for your project. oc sync ${ OPERATOR_NAMESPACE } 3. Register the operator in a DevOps Pipeline \u00b6 Start the process to create a pipeline using Tekton. oc pipeline --tekton The first time a pipeline is registered in the namespace, the CLI will ask for a username and Password / Personal Access Token for the Git repository that will be stored in a secret named git-credentials . Username : Enter your GitHub user id Personal Access Token : Paste your GitHub personal access token The CLI will attempt to determine the runtime of your repository. It should detect that it is an operator and prompt you to select ibm-operator pipeline or ibm-operator-catalog pipeline. Select ibm-operator pipeline. When registering a Tekton pipeline, the CLI also reads the available parameters from the pipeline and generates prompts for input. In this case, the option of scanning the built image for vulnerabilities is the only options. The scan is performed by the Vulnerability Advisor if you are using IBM Image Registry or by Trivy if another image registry is used. This scan is performed in \"scan\" stage of pipeline after \"img-release\" stage. ? scan-image: Enable the pipeline to scan the image for vulnerabilities? ( Y/n ) To skip the scan, you have type \"n\" (No). Otherwise, type \"y\" (Yes) for performing Vulnerability Scanning on the image. After the pipeline has been created,the command will set up a webhook from the Git host to the pipeline event listener. Note if the webhook registration step fails, it is likely because the Git credentials are incorrect or do not have enough permission in the repository. When the command is completed it will present options for next steps. You can use the Tekton cli commands to inspect the pipeline run that has been created and tail the log and/or navigate to the provided url to see the pipeline running from the OpenShift console. 4. View your application pipeline \u00b6 Open the OpenShift Web Console oc console OR From menu on the left switch to the Developer mode Select dev project that was used for the application pipeline registration In the left menu, select Pipelines You will see your application DevOps pipeline now starting to build and once completed will look like the image below. Register the operator catalog pipeline \u00b6 The operator catalog repository is a simple repo used to keep track of the operator bundles that will be packaged together in the catalog. Even though you may start with one operator, it is assumed that ultimately multiple operators will be managed together in one catalog. Open the operator catalog template repository and create a repository for the operator catalog using the template Copy the repository url Create/connect to the project for the operator development. This does not need to be the same one used for the operator build. oc sync ${ OPERATOR_NAMESPACE } Register the pipeline for the operator catalog oc pipeline --tekton ${ GIT_URL } Register the catalog repository with the operator pipeline \u00b6 The last step of the operator pipeline will update the operator catalog repository with the new version of the operator bundle that was created. This update will trigger the creation of a new version of the catalog. Change to the project where the operator pipeline was registered oc project ${ OPERATOR_NAMESPACE } Change the directory to the local clone of your operator catalog repository Register the url for the operator catalog repository for the operator pipeline igc git-secret olm-catalog-repo Kick off the operator pipeline again to update the operator catalog repo Configure the GitOps repo \u00b6 If you don't already have one, create a GitOps repo from the gitops template template Clone the GitOps repo to the local machine git clone ${ GIT_URL } Change the directory to the cloned GitOps repo Change to the project where the operator catalog pipeline was registered oc project ${ OPERATOR_NAMESPACE } Register the GitOps repo url oc gitops Trigger the operator catalog pipeline build to register the catalog source in the GitOps repo Configure ArgoCD to deploy the CatalogSource into the namespace openshift-marketplace","title":"Build an Operator"},{"location":"adopting/use-cases/operator/operator/#building-an-operator","text":"Set up DevOps pipelines to build an operator and operator catalog The Cloud-Native Toolkit provides Tekton pipelines to automate the process to build and deploy operator-based applications.

The work is managed as an Open Source project and contribution is welcome from anyone that would like to participate. The following guidelines will help everyone navigate the process of contributing. (Most of these steps will generally apply to any Open Source project.) Project structure \u00b6 Before diving into the steps, it's important to get a general understanding of the organization structure of the repositories. The various components that make up the Cloud-Native Toolkit are organized into different git repositories that are aligned around solution space, release schedule, and intended audience. Currently, these repositories are divided between two public Git organizations: github.com/ibm-garage-cloud github.com/IBM All of the repositories in the github.com/ibm-garage-cloud organization belong to the Cloud-Native Toolkit. Within the github.com/IBM organization only the following repositories contain Cloud-Native Toolkit content: IBM/template-graphql-typescript IBM/template-java-spring IBM/template-node-angular IBM/template-node-react IBM/template-node-typescript IBM/ibm-garage-tekton-tasks IBM/template-argocd-gitops IBM/template-ibmcloud-services (These repositories have been relocated to the github.com/IBM because their content applies more broadly than the Cloud-Native Toolkit and/or fits in with the larger catalog of related Code Pattern and Starter Kit content). How to contribute \u00b6 1. Look through the issues \u00b6 Info Prerequisite: We use ZenHub to add metadata to the Git issues so they can be managed via a Kanban board. ZenHub also allows us to show the issues and pull requests from the various repositories in on place. Viewing the issues with ZenHub requires a Chrome extension . We highly recommend installing this extension to help search the issues. Whether you have a question/issue with existing behavior or an idea for a new feature that can be added to the Toolkit, the place to begin is looking through the issues. Each repository has its own list of issues. If you have an issue with content from a specific repository then any related issues will likely be found there. However, given the wide range of repositories and the interconnected nature of many of the components it is usually best to look at the ZenHub board. The following steps are the best way to view the board: Open the github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/planning repository Click on the ZenHub link along the top menu. Note: You must install the ZenHub extension for the link to appear Look at the Repos drop-down in the top-right of the board to ensure all the issues for the various Cloud-Native Toolkit repositories have been displayed. If the drop-down does not read Repos (24/24) then do the following to select them all: Click on the Repos drop-down Select the Show all repos link Use the filters and/or the search bar to find cards related to your issue. If you find an existing ticket that is related to your issue, add your information to the card. Existing defect \u00b6 If you find an existing defect, be sure to add a comment with the details of your specific scenario. When the defect has been addressed and the ticket has been moved to the Review/QA stage, we will ask you to help test the solution in your environment. Existing feature \u00b6 If you find an existing feature request, please indicate your interest through a comment. As appropriate, include the business requirements or user story that is driving the request. We will use this input to help determine prioritization of new features. No issue found \u00b6 If you are unable to find a card that is related to your issue or feature, proceed to the next step to create a new issue. The search doesn't need to be an exhaustive one and if there is any question whether the item is new or a duplicate, go ahead and create a new issue. We'd rather have the item captured and mark it as a duplicate after the fact, if necessary, than to have an issue fall through the cracks. 2. Create a new issue \u00b6 If you could not find an existing issue related to your problem or feature then its time to create a new issue. Issues fall in one of two categories: Bug Feature Bug \u00b6 Bugs can be either be reported against the repository that has the problem or in the general github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/planning repository. These are the steps for reporting a bug: Navigate to the repository in the browser Click on the Issues menu item at the top then click on New Issue Click Get Started on the Bug report template to create a new issue from the template. Note At the moment, some repositories do not have Bug report templates defined. If a template does not exist you will see the blank issue dialog. 4. Provide all the information relevant to the bug, particularly the details of your scenario and the steps to reproduce Feature \u00b6 Features should be reported against the github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/planning repository. These are the steps for requesting a feature: Navigate to the github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/planning repository in the browser Click on the Issues menu item at the top then click on New Issue Click Get Started on the Feature request template to create a new issue from the template Provide all the information relevant to the bug, particularly the details of the problem addressed by the feature and the impact/benefit of implementing the feature 3. Setup your repository for development \u00b6 On an Open Source project there are typically a few maintainers who have direct access to the repositories and a larger number of contributors who do not. In this case, the way to introduce changes to the repositories is through a fork. The process for setting up the fork is as follows: Note Even though the maintainers have direct access to the repositories, we follow this same process of working off of a fork of the upstream repository as a best practice. Clone the repository to which you want to introduce changes (the upstream repository) to your local machine git clone { upstream repo url } Create a fork of the upstream repository by pressing the Fork button at the top of the page Copy the url of the repository fork Open a terminal to the cloned directory and run the following to set the push url to be the url of the repository fork git remote set-url --push origin { fork repo url } List the remotes for the local repository clone to verify that the fetch and push urls are pointing to the appropriate repositories git remote -v The output should look something like the following, with the fetch pointing to the upstream url and the push pointing to the fork With the local clone set up this way, any time you get changes from the remote (e.g. git pull ) the changes will be pulled from the upstream repository. Similarly, when you push changes they will be pushed to the fork . 4. Develop your changes \u00b6 Now that you have a fork and a local clone of the repository, you can start making your changes. This part is mostly business-as-usual for software development. We have a couple of best practices we recommend: Work in a branch \u00b6 It is a best practice to make your changes in a separate branch, even though the changes will be made in your own fork. There are at least two good reasons for doing this: The branch can be named after the issue number and the feature Naming the branch according to the change that is being made provides a bit of documentation for the purpose of the branch. It also helps enforce the notion that the branch exists only for the implementation of that feature. The branch can be rebased when new changes come in from the upstream Through the course of development of the branch, other changes may be introduced in the upstream repository. Making the changes in a separate branch allows for the upstream changes to be easily pulled in on the master branch and applied to other branches as appropriate. Create the branch by running: git checkout -b { branch name } Push the branch up to your fork by running: git push -u origin { branch name } Commit message format \u00b6 Each commit message should clearly describe the changes that are being made. During the development process as many small changes are made, a single one-liner is sufficient for the commit message. With larger changes or when the changes in the branch are squashed into a single commit, the following commit message format is preferred. Writing commit messages \u00b6 <type> indicates the type of commit that\u2019s being made. This can be: feat , fix , perf , docs , chore , style , refactor . <scope> the scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change or the thing(s) that changed. <subject> the subject should be a short overview of the change. <body> the body should be a detailed description of the change(s). This can be prose or a bulleted listing. <issue reference> the issue reference should be a reference to the issue number under which this change is being made. The issue reference should be in the format of {git org}/{git repo}#{issue number} Commit message format: type(<scope>): <subject> <BLANK LINE> <body> <BLANK LINE> <issue reference> Create a draft pull request when the branch is first pushed to the fork \u00b6 GitHub recently introduced draft pull requests that allow a pull request to be recorded but marked as not yet ready for review. Git provides a url to open a pull request the first time a branch is first pushed to the remote, which gives an excellent and easy opportunity to create the draft. Note Be sure to link the pull request with the issue Creating a draft pull request early has the following benefits: Clicking the link provided by Git sets up the source and target repos/branches for you so you don't need to hunt around Having the draft pull request gives insight for everyone else where the work is being done Push changes to your fork frequently during development \u00b6 As you are making changes, push them frequently to the fork. This ensures that your code is backed up somewhere and allows everyone else to see what activity is happening. It also means that if you get pulled into some other work, the latest version of your changes are available for others to possibly pick up where you left off. Pull in the latest changes from master frequently and rebase your branch \u00b6 It is good to make sure you are always working off of the latest code from the upstream. With the changes in a separate branch, it is easy to bring in upstream changes with the following steps: Checkout master in the local clone git checkout master Pull in the changes from the upstream repository git pull Check out your branch git checkout { branch } Rebase your branch on master git rebase master Force push the changes git push --force-with-lease 5. Create your pull request \u00b6 GitHub has recently added a new feature that allows a pull request to put into draft status. This is helpful to record a pull request as pending work even if the changes are not yet ready for review. Open your fork repository in a browser Click New pull request Select the appropriate target and source branches for the pull request and press Create pull request base repository is the target repository into which your changes should be merged (should be the upstream repository) base is the target branch in the upstream repository into which your changes should be merged (typically this will be master ) head repository is the source of the changes (this should be your fork repository) compare is the branch containing your changes that should be merged Write the title and description of the pull request How to write the perfect pull request Link the pull request to the related issue Click Create pull request or Create draft pull request to submit Note A pull request can be converted to a draft after it was created by clicking on the Convert to draft link located under the Reviewers section on the right-hand side. 6. Prepare your branch to submit the pull request for review \u00b6 Pull in the latest changes from master frequently and rebase your branch, as described in the previous section (Optionally) Rebase your branch to squash commits and clean up commit messages. An interactive rebase will allow you to clean up your branch before submitting it for review. This will reduce the number of commits down to the core set of changes that reflect the feature/bug fix, remove any commits that aren't part of the change you are making, and clean up the commit messages to clearly describe the changes and follow the commit message format guidelines. 7. Submit your pull request for review \u00b6 Assuming you have previously created a draft pull request, when you are ready to have your code reviewed and merged then you will need to indicate that in the pull request. Open the browser to the upstream repository. Select the Pull requests tab, find your pull request in the list and open it. Press the Ready for review button to tell the maintainers the pull request is ready to be processed. 8. Update your pull request \u00b6 Keep an eye on the pull request after it has been submitted for review. The maintainers may have questions or request changes before the pull request can be closed. The GitHub system should notify you when changes are made to your pull request. Also, the maintainers all have day jobs and sometimes pull requests get overlooked. If your pull request has sat for a while you can get some attention to it by tagging one of the maintainers in a commit comment: E.g. @seansund @csantana @bwoolf1 @lsteck","title":"Contribute"},{"location":"contribute/contribute/#contributing-to-the-project","text":"","title":"Contributing to the project"},{"location":"contribute/contribute/#cloud-native-toolkit","text":"Cloud-Native Toolkit is an organized effort managed by the IBM Garage to help development teams build and deliver cloud-native solutions deployed to IBM Cloud with IBM Kubernetes and Red Hat OpenShift Managed Service.

Build the development docker container image, this is only need it once if the dependencies have not changed. Run npm run dev:build To start developing run command npm run dev in the root directory of the git repo (where package.json and mkdocs.yaml are located) Open a browser to http://localhost:8000 , where you will see the documentation site. This will live update as you save changes to the Markdown files in the docs folder To stop developing run command npm dev:stop in another terminal window, which will terminate the docker container View the scripts section of package.json in the root folder of the git repo for additional options available To build the static HTML file and check all links and spelling run command npm run build To check links in the built site ( npm run build must be run first), use the linkchecker, with command npm run dev:links . This command should be run in the root folder of the project, containing the linkcheckerrc file. To check spelling npm run dev:spell should be run in the root folder of the project, containing the cspell.json file. Local mkdocs and python tooling installation You can install MkDocs and associated plugins on your development system and run the tools locally: Install Python 3 on your system Clone or Fork the documentation repository cd into the documentation directory Install the required python packages `pip install -r requirements.txt' Install the spell checker using command npm ci Note sudo command may be needed to install globally, depending on your system configuration You now have all the tools installed to be able to create the static HTML site from the markdown documents. The documentation for MkDocs provides full instructions for using MkDocs, but the important commands are: mkdocs build will build the static site. This must be run in the root directory of the repo, where mkdocs.yml is located mkdocs serve will build the static site and launch a test server on http://localhost:8000 . Every time a document is modified the website will automatically be updated and any browser open will be refreshed to the latest. To check links in the built site ( mkdocs build must be run first), use the linkchecker, with command npm run dev:links . This command should be run in the root folder of the project, containing the linkcheckerrc file. To check spelling npm run dev:spell should be run in the root folder of the project, containing the cspell.json file. The developer guide is created using MkDocs with the Materials theme theme. MkDocs takes Markdown documents and turns them into a static website, that can be accessed from a filesystem or served from a web server. A link checker tool is also used to validate all links in the MkDocs generated website. Document layout \u00b6 The documentation is organized into distinct sections to provide easy navigation and allow self-service viewers to get started, then dive into deeper content with a clear path. The sections are as follows: Overview - This is high level information about the Cloud-Native Toolkit. What it is and why does it exist. Install - This is a section designed to help the first time user get up and running with minimal knowledge. More advanced install options are provided in a later section Learning - This section is designed to teach the fundamentals of Cloud-Native development with the toolkit. Using a default installation of the Toolkit to work through Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery. This section is more about Cloud-Native development and how the Toolkit provides functionality to support Cloud-Native development rather than a deep dive on specific tools that are part of the toolkit. Adopting - This section is designed to move from the initial learning phase to adopting the Toolkit as part of development activities. It covers more advanced installation options, customization options, best practices and how the Toolkit can be applied to certain use cases Reference - The reference section is the technical documentation for the resources delivered by the Toolkit. Resources - The resources section provides links to content outside the toolkit that someone learning the toolkit may find useful Contributing - This section provides how someone can become a contributor to the Cloud-Native Toolkit project, which includes the core Toolkit, adding additional starter kits or pipeline tasks, updating or adding to the documentation. Creating content \u00b6 MkDocs supports standard Markdown syntax and a set Markdown extensions provided by plugins. The exact Markdown syntax supported is based on the python implementation . MkDocs is configured using the mkdocs.yml file in the root of the git repository. For the prototype, the existing Gatsby content is still within the repository, with the prototype content located in the mkdocs directory. The mkdoc.yml file defines the top level navigation for the site. The level of indentation is configurable (this requires the theme to support this feature) with Markdown headings, levels 2 ( ## ) and 3 ( ### ) being used for the page navigation on the right of the page. Standard Markdown features \u00b6 The following markdown syntax is used within the documentation Todo Complete the table below Syntax Result # Title a level 1 heading containing. You can create up to 6 levels of headings by adding additional # characters, so ### is a level 3 heading **text** will display the word text in bold *text* will display the word text in italic HTML can be embedded in Markdown, but in the documentation it is preferred to stick with pure Markdown with the installed extensions. Links within MkDocs generated content \u00b6 MkDocs will warn of any internal broken links, so it is important that links within the documentation are recognized as internal links. a link starting with a protocol name, such as http or https, is an external link a link starting with / is an external link. This is because MkDocs generated content can be embedded into another web application, so links can point outside of the MkDocs generated site but hosted on the same website a link starting with a file name (including the .md extension) or relative directory (../directory/filename.md) is an internal link and will be verified by MkDocs Information Internal links should be to the Markdown file (with .md extension). When the site is generated the filename will be automatically converted to the correct URL As part of the build process a linkchecker application will check the generated html site for any broken links. You can run this linkchecker locally using the instructions. If any links in the documentation should be excluded from the link checker, such as links to localhost, then they should be added as a regex to the linkcheckerrc file, located in the root folder of the project - see linkchecker documentation for additional information Extensions used in the prototype \u00b6 There are a number of Markdown extensions being used in the prototype. See the mkdocs.yml file to see which extensions are configured. The documentation for the extensions can be found here Link configuration \u00b6 Links on the page or embedded images can be annotated to control the links and also the appearance of the links: Image \u00b6 Images are embedded in a page using the standard Markdown syntax ![description](URL) , but the image can be formatted with Attribute Lists . This is most commonly used to scale an image or center an image, e.g. ![ GitHub repo url ]( images/github-repo-url.png ){style=\"width: 80%\" .center } External Links \u00b6 External links can also use attribute lists to control behaviors, such as open in new tab or add a css class attribute to the generated HTML, such as external in the example below: [ MkDocs ]( http://mkdocs.org ){: target=\"_blank\" .external } Info You can use {: target=_blank} to create clickable images that launch to another site: [![Image description](Image URL)](target URL \"hover text\"){: target=_blank} YouTube videos \u00b6 It is possible to embed a YouTube video and have it play in place using pure markdown. You can use HTML to embed a video: < iframe width = \"100%\" height = \"500\" src = \"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V-BFLaPdoPo\" title = \"YouTube video player\" frameborder = \"0\" allow = \"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen ></ iframe > Tabs \u00b6 Content can be organized into a set of horizontal tabs. === \"Tab 1\" Hello === \"Tab 2\" World produces : Tab 1 Hello Tab 2 World Information boxes \u00b6 The Admonition extension allows you to add themed information boxes using the !!! and ??? syntax: !!! note This is a note produces: Note This is a note and ??? note This is a note You can add a `+` character to force the box to be initially open `???+` produces a collapsible box: Note This is a collapsible note You can add a + character to force the box to be initially open ???+ You can override the title of the box by providing a title after the Admonition type. Example You can also nest different components as required note Note This is a note collapsible note Note This is a note custom title note Sample Title This is a note Markdown !!!Example You can also nest different components as required === \"note\" !!!note This is a note === \"collapsible note\" ???+note This is a note === \"custom title note\" !!!note \"Sample Title\" This is a note Supported Admonition Classes \u00b6 The Admonitions supported by the Material theme are : Note This is a note Abstract This is an abstract Info This is an info Tip This is a tip Success This is a success Question This is a question Warning This is a warning Failure This is a failure Danger This is a danger Bug This is a bug Example This is an example Quote This is a quote Code blocks \u00b6 Code blocks allow you to insert code or blocks of text in line or as a block. To use inline you simply enclose the text using a single back quote ` character. So a command can be included using `oc get pods` and will create oc get pods When you want to include a block of code you use a fence , which is 3 back quote character at the start and end of the block. After the opening quotes you should also specify the content type contained in the block. ``` shell oc get pods ``` which will produce: oc get pods Notice that the block automatically gets the copy to clipboard link to allow easy copy and paste. Every code block needs to identify the content. Where there is no content type, then text should be used to identify the content as plain text. Some of the common content types are shown in the table below. However, a full link of supported content types can be found here , where the short name in the documentation should be used. type Content shell Shell script content powershell Windows Power Shell content bat Windows batch file (.bat or .cmd files) json JSON content yaml YAML content markdown or md Markdown content java Java programming language javascript or js JavaScript programming language typescript or ts TypeScript programming language text Plain text content Advanced highlighting of code blocks \u00b6 There are some additional features available due to the highlight plugin installed in MkDocs. Full details can be found in the MkDocs Materials documentation . Line numbers \u00b6 You can add line numbers to a code block with the linenums directive. You must specify the starting line number, 1 in the example below: ``` javascript linenums=\"1\" <script> document.getElementById(\"demo\").innerHTML = \"My First JavaScript\"; </script> ``` creates 1 2 3 < script > document . getElementById ( \"demo\" ). innerHTML = \"My First JavaScript\" ; < /script> Info The line numbers do not get included when the copy to clipboard link is selected Code highlighting \u00b6 You can highlight specific lines of code using the hl_lines directive. The line numbers starts at 1 for the first line of code. If you want multiple lines highlighted, then provide the line numbers separated with a space. Below lines 1 and 3 are highlighted: ``` javascript hl_lines=\"1 3\" <script> document.getElementById(\"demo\").innerHTML = \"My First JavaScript\"; </script> ``` creates < script > document . getElementById ( \"demo\" ). innerHTML = \"My First JavaScript\" ; < /script> It is possible to combine line number and highlighting. Below I start the line numbers at 10 and highlight the second line of code: ``` javascript linenums=\"10\" hl_lines=\"2\" <script> document.getElementById(\"demo\").innerHTML = \"My First JavaScript\"; </script> ``` creates 10 11 12 < script > document . getElementById ( \"demo\" ). innerHTML = \"My First JavaScript\" ; < /script> Redirects \u00b6 To help external sites wanting to link to the documentation there are a number of vanity links maintained using the redirect plugin . The links are defined in the mkdocs.yml file and documented on the Additional Resources page. To ensure the auto-generated link page does not get reported by the link checker, an entry needs to be added to the nofollow section of the link checker config file, linkcheckerrc in the root directory of the project. E.g. if a link /help was created then an entry in the nofollow section should be public/help.html$ . Spell checking \u00b6 This project uses cSpell to check spelling within the markdown. The configuration included in the project automatically excludes content in a code block, enclosed in triple back quotes ```. The configuration file also specifies that US English is the language used in the documentation, so only US English spellings should be used for words where alternate international English spellings exist. You can add words to be considered valid either within a markdown document or within the cspell configuration file, cspell.json , in the root folder of the documentation repository. Words defined within a page only apply to that page, but words added to the configuration file apply to the entire project. Adding local words \u00b6 You can add a list of words to be considered valid for spell checking purposes as a comment in a Markdown file. The comment has a specific format to be picked up by the cSpell tool: <!--- cSpell:ignore linkchecker linkcheckerrc mkdocs mkdoc --> here the words linkchecker , linkcheckerrc , mkdocs and mkdoc are specified as words to be accepted by the spell checker within the file containing the comment. Adding global words \u00b6 The cSpell configuration file cspell.json contains a list of words that should always be considered valid when spell checking. The list of words applies to all files being checked.","title":"Documentation"},{"location":"contribute/documentation/#updating-the-developer-guide","text":"","title":"Updating the Developer Guide"},{"location":"contribute/documentation/#setting-up-a-documentation-environment","text":"To work on documentation and be able to view the rendered web site you need to create an environment, which comprises of: Tooling within a Docker container You can use a Docker container and run MkDocs from the container, so no local installation is required: You need to have Docker installed and running on your system There are helper configurations installed if you have npm from Node.JS installed.

For the Cloud-Native Toolkit participation can take on a number of different forms. The following roles detail a number of ways in which people might interact with the Toolkit. Consumers \u00b6 Consumers are members of the community who are applying assets to their development projects. Anyone who wants to apply any of the assets can be a user. We encourage consumers to participate as evangelists and contributors as well. Evangelists \u00b6 Evangelists are members of the community who help others become consumers of the assets. They do so by: Advertising the assets and encouraging others to use them Supporting new consumers and answering questions, such as on Slack (IBM internal) Reporting bugs or missing features through GitHub issues Contributors \u00b6 Contributors are members of the community who help maintain, improve, and expand the assets. In addition to using and evangelizing the assets, they make the assets better by: Resolving issues in GitHub to fix bugs, add features, and improve documentation Submitting changes as GitHub pull requests Maintainers \u00b6 Project maintainers (aka maintainers) are owners of the project who are committed to the success of the assets in that project. Each project has a team of maintainers, and each team has a lead. In addition to their participation as contributors, maintainers have privileges to: Label, close, and manage GitHub issues Close and merge GitHub pull requests Nominate and vote on new maintainers Types of teams \u00b6 Core team \u00b6 Core team members are IBM employees responsible for the leadership and strategic direction of the set of Catalyst projects as a whole. The core team also directs how the Catalyst strategy will evolve with IBM Cloud product decisions. Core team responsibilities include: Actively engaging with the projects' communities Setting overall direction and vision Setting priorities and release schedule Focusing on broad, cross-cutting concerns Spinning up or shutting down project teams The core team will operate the technical steering committee. Technical steering committee \u00b6 The technical steering committee coordinates the project teams to ensure consistency between the projects and fosters collaboration between the core team and each project team. This close communication on cross-cutting concerns greatly mitigates the risk of misalignment that can come from decentralized efforts. The committee consists of the project leads of all of the projects as well as other members of the core team who may not presently be leading any projects. Project teams \u00b6 Each project team maintains the assets in its project. Therefore, its members are the maintainers of the assets. Each project operates independently, though it should follow this governance structure to define roles, responsibilities, and decision-making protocols. The project has a project lead, a lead maintainer who should also be a member of the technical steering committee. Each project lead is responsible for: Acting as a point of primary contact for the team Participating in the technical steering committee Deciding on the initial membership of project maintainers (in consultation with the core team) Determining and publishing project team policies and mechanics, including the way maintainers join and leave the team (which should be based on team consensus) Communicating core vision to the team Ensuring that issues and pull requests progress at a reasonable rate Making final decisions in cases where the team is unable to reach consensus (should be rare) The way that project teams communicate internally and externally is left to each team, but: Technical discussion should take place in the public domain as much as possible, ideally in GitHub issues and pull requests. Each project should have a dedicated Slack channel (IBM internal). Decisions from Slack discussions should be captured in GitHub issues. Project teams should actively seek out discussion and input from stakeholders who are not members of the team. Project Governance \u00b6 Planning \u00b6 Project planning is managed in a Kanban board , specifically this Zenhub board: Planning Zenhub Decision-making \u00b6 Project teams should use consensus decision making as much as possible, but resort to lack of consensus decision making when necessary. Consensus \u00b6 Project teams use consensus decision-making with the premise that a successful outcome is not where one side of a debate has \"won,\" but rather where concerns from all sides have been addressed in some way. This emphatically does not mean design by committee, nor compromised design. Rather, it's a recognition that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a 100% right answer. Breakthrough thinking sometimes end up changing the playing field by eliminating tradeoffs altogether, but more often, difficult decisions have to be made. The key is to have a clear vision and set of values and priorities , which is the core team's responsibility to set and communicate, and the project teams' responsibility to act upon. Whenever possible, seek to reach consensus through discussion and design iteration. Concretely, the steps are: New GitHub issue or pull request is created with initial analysis of tradeoffs. Comments reveal additional drawbacks, problems, or tradeoffs. The issue or pull request is revised to address comments, often by improving the design or implementation. Repeat above until \"major objections\" are fully addressed, or it's clear that there is a fundamental choice to be made. Consensus is reached when most people are left with only \"minor\" objections. While they might choose the tradeoffs slightly differently, they do not feel a strong need to actively block the issue or pull request from progressing. One important question is: consensus among which people, exactly? Of course, the broader the consensus, the better. When a decision in a project team affects other teams (e.g. new/changed API), the team will be encouraged to invite people (e.g. leads) from affected teams. But at the very least, consensus within the members of the project team should be the norm for most decisions . If the core team has done its job of communicating the values and priorities, it should be possible to fit the debate about the issue into that framework and reach a fairly clear outcome. Lack of consensus \u00b6 In some cases, though, consensus cannot be reached. These cases tend to split into two very different camps: \"Trivial\" reasons , e.g., there is not widespread agreement about naming, but there is consensus about the substance. \"Deep\" reasons , e.g., the design fundamentally improves one set of concerns at the expense of another, and people on both sides feel strongly about it.

This section assumes you have the development tools for your preferred programming language already installed. It only covers the tooling for the Cloud-Native Toolkit. Prerequisites \u00b6 To complete the cloud-Native Toolkit learning, you need to have a laptop or workstation running Linux, MacOS or MS Windows. If running linux you may need to adapt some of the instructions to match your Linux distribution a web browser, capable of running modern web sites an active, public, GitHub account access to a Red Hat OpenShift cluster. If one has not been provided or you did not set one up please work through the Install section to get access to a cluster. This guide assumes that you have some basic knowledge of Kubernetes, Docker, and modern software delivery techniques including CI/CD. There are some suggested educational materials listed in the Resources section. Cluster Command Line Tools \u00b6 You will be using the command line for some of the tasks you will learn about as you work through the learning material. If you are using the Open Labs environment, then you can skip installing command line tools locally as the Open Labs environment provides a web-based command line. If you are working with a cluster running on the IBM Cloud then you have the option to use the IBM Cloud Shell rather than a local command prompt. If you opt to use the IBM Cloud Shell then don't need any local command line tools installed. If you installed your own cluster following the fast-start instructions then you should already have the command line tools installed. If you don't need, or already have the command line tools installed then you can jump to the User accounts section, other wise continue to install the required tools. Installing Command Line Tools \u00b6 The set of command line tools you need depends on the cluster you will be using to complete the learning: IBM Cloud based clusters need the IBM Cloud Command Line Interface (CLI) OpenShift clusters need the RedHat oc command IBM Cloud CLI \u00b6 To install the IBM Cloud CLI follow the instructions in the IBM Cloud documentation . RedHat oc command \u00b6 The oc command is available from all installations of RedHat OpenShift or CodeReady Containers. Navigate and log into the web console for the cluster, then in the dropdown accessed by clicking the help icon (a question mark next to you username at the top of the web console) you will find a link to the install images for various operating systems. The install images are also available to download from RedHat . Be sure to get the latest version of the oc command. User accounts \u00b6 You'll need the following accounts to complete the Cloud-Native Toolkit learning. Github account \u00b6 Todo CRC cannot be triggered by github - what to use? You will need a GitHub account (public, not enterprise) to use the Starter Kit templates. Create one if you do not have one already. If you have not logged in for a while, make sure your login is working. Ensure you have a git command line tool installed. You can verify you have a working git command line interface by entering the command git version in a command or terminal window. If you don't have git installed then you can download it from here Configure a Github personal access token \u00b6 For the automation you will learn as part of the Continuous Integration process you will need a GitHub personal access token with public_repo and write:repo_hook scopes. A Personal Access Token is used in place of a user password to authenticate with GitHub. The Personal Access Token only needs to be generated once because it is associated with a GitHub user or organization and can be used to access any of the user's/organization's repositories. Navigate to Developer Settings and generate a new token; name it something like \"CI pipeline\" Select public_repo scope to enable git clone Select write:repo_hook scope so the pipeline can create a web hook The GitHub UI will never again let you see this token, so be sure to save the token in your password manager or somewhere safe that you can access later on IBM Cloud account \u00b6 If you will be using a cluster hosted in the IBM cloud, then you need to have an active IBM Cloud account. Create an IBM Cloud account , if you don't have one already, and make sure you can log in. Create an IBM Cloud API Key \u00b6 API Keys are tokens scoped to a particular IBM Cloud account that can be used to access cloud services, particularly through the IBM Cloud CLI. Generate an API Key for whichever account contains the cluster you will be using for the Getting Started activities. Follow these steps to create an API key and download the key to a file. Be sure to include a descriptive name of the API Key so you know where it is used. Install the Cloud-Native Toolkit Command Line Interface (CLI) \u00b6 The Cloud-Native Toolkit provides extensions to the kubernetes and OpenShift command line tools to provide convenient helper functions to speed up development activities. The additional commands are detailed in the reference section. The Cloud-Native Toolkit CLI needs to be installed in all development environments (including the OpenLabs and IBM Cloud Shell environments) To install the Cloud-Native Toolkit CLI run the following command: curl -sL shell.cloudnativetoolkit.dev | sh - source ~/.bashrc || source ~/.zshrc Note If you have access to multiple IBM Cloud accounts you may find the IBM Cloud cluster fast-switching tool (icc) of use.

A preferred model for implementing continuous delivery is GitOps, where the desired state of the operational environment is defined in a source control repository (namely Git). What is continuous delivery \u00b6 Continuous delivery is the DevOps approach of frequently making new versions of an application's components available for deployment to a runtime environment. The process involves automation of the build and validation process and concludes with a new version of the application that is available for promotion to another environment. Continuous delivery is closely related to continuous deployment. The distinction is: Continuous delivery deploys an application when a user manually triggers deployment Continuous deployment deploys an application automatically when it is ready Typically, continuous deployment is an evolution of a continuous delivery process. An application is ready for deployment when it passes a set of tests that prove it doesn't contain any significant problems. Once these tests have been automated in a way that reliably verifies the application components then the deployment can be automated. Additionally, for continuous delivery it important to employ other best practices around moving and managing changes in an environment: blue-green deployments, shadow deployments, and feature toggles to name a few. Until these practices are in place and verified, it is best to stick with continuous delivery. As with most cloud-native practices, the move from continuous deployment to continuous delivery would not be done in a \"big bang\" but incrementally and as different application components are ready. What is GitOps \u00b6 GitOps is the operational pattern of using source code repositories (namely Git) as the source of truth for defining the configuration that makes up the desired state of the operational environment. Git repositories are used to declaratively represent the desired state of applications in deployment environments. GitOps takes advantage of several Git features: Git provides a versioned history of changes, listing what was changed and who made the change Change releases can be managed from a pull request, allowing multiple people to make changes but a select few to approve the changes Git provides access control mechanisms to limit who can change and view the configuration Git enables changes to be rolled back quickly if there is an issue with a new release Git supports multiple models for change management: Branches, Forks, GitFlow, etc Hosted git providers (like GitHub) provide a rich API that allows the different operations to be automated, if desired CI/CD integration \u00b6 For the full end-to-end build and delivery process, both the CI and CD pipelines are used. When working in a containerized environment such as Kubernetes or Red Hat OpenShift, the responsibilities between the two processes are clearly defined: The CI pipeline is responsible for building validating and packaging the \"raw materials\" (source code, deployment configuration, etc) into versioned, deployable artifacts (container images, helm charts, published artifacts, etc) The CD pipeline is responsible for applying the deployable artifacts into a particular target environment A change made to one of the source repositories triggers the CI process. The CI process builds, validates, and packages those changes into deployable artifacts that are stored in the image registry and artifact repository(ies). The last step of the CI process updates the GitOps repository with information about the updated artifacts. At a minimum this step stores updates the version number to the newly released versions of the artifacts but depending on the environment this step might also update the deployment configuration. Note It is also possible to trigger a process when a new image is available in the image registry or a new artifact is available to the artifact management system. In this case, the CI process could be split into two parts: 1. create the container image and artifacts, and 2. update the GitOps repo with the available artifacts. Changes to the GitOps repository trigger the CD pipeline to run In the CD pipeline, the configuration describing the desired state as defined in the GitOps repository is reconciled with the actual state of the environment and resources are created, updated, or destroyed as appropriate. Tools to support Continuous Delivery \u00b6 The practice of (CD) can be accomplished in different ways and with different tools. It is possible and certainly valid to use the same tool for both CI and CD (e.g. Tekton or Jenkins) with caution you enforce a clear separation between the two processes. Typically, that would result in two distinct pipelines to respond to changes that happen within the two different Git repositories - source repo and gitops repo. Another class of tools is available that are particularly suited for Continuous Delivery and GitOps. The following is by no means an exhaustive list but it does provide some of the common tools used for CD in a cloud-native environment: ArgoCD Flux IBM Multicloud Manager","title":"DevOps"},{"location":"learning/devops/#dev-ops-concepts","text":"This short video introduces the concepts of DevOps with Red Hat OpenShift:","title":"Dev-Ops Concepts"},{"location":"learning/devops/#continuous-delivery","text":"In IBM Garage Method, one of the Develop practices is continuous delivery .

GitOps takes advantage of several Git features: Git provides a versioned history of changes, listing what was changed and who made the change Change releases can be managed from a pull request, allowing multiple people to make changes but a select few to approve the changes Git provides access control mechanisms to limit who can change and view the configuration Git enables changes to be rolled back quickly if there is an issue with a new release Git supports multiple models for change management: Branches, Forks, GitFlow, etc Hosted git providers (like GitHub) provide a rich API that allows the different operations to be automated, if desired","title":"What is GitOps"},{"location":"learning/devops/#cicd-integration","text":"For the full end-to-end build and delivery process, both the CI and CD pipelines are used. When working in a containerized environment such as Kubernetes or Red Hat OpenShift, the responsibilities between the two processes are clearly defined: The CI pipeline is responsible for building validating and packaging the \"raw materials\" (source code, deployment configuration, etc) into versioned, deployable artifacts (container images, helm charts, published artifacts, etc) The CD pipeline is responsible for applying the deployable artifacts into a particular target environment A change made to one of the source repositories triggers the CI process. The CI process builds, validates, and packages those changes into deployable artifacts that are stored in the image registry and artifact repository(ies). The last step of the CI process updates the GitOps repository with information about the updated artifacts. At a minimum this step stores updates the version number to the newly released versions of the artifacts but depending on the environment this step might also update the deployment configuration. Note It is also possible to trigger a process when a new image is available in the image registry or a new artifact is available to the artifact management system. In this case, the CI process could be split into two parts: 1. create the container image and artifacts, and 2. update the GitOps repo with the available artifacts. Changes to the GitOps repository trigger the CD pipeline to run In the CD pipeline, the configuration describing the desired state as defined in the GitOps repository is reconciled with the actual state of the environment and resources are created, updated, or destroyed as appropriate.","title":"CI/CD integration"},{"location":"learning/devops/#tools-to-support-continuous-delivery","text":"The practice of (CD) can be accomplished in different ways and with different tools.

The deployment environment is a namespace in a container platform like Kubernetes or Red Hat OpenShift. Argo CD models a collection of applications as a project and uses a Git repository to store the application's desired state. Argo CD is flexible in the structure of the application configuration represented in the Git repository. Argo CD supports defining Kubernetes manifests in a number of ways: helm charts kustomize ksonnet jsonnet plain directory of yaml/json manifests custom plugins Argo CD compares the actual state of the application in the cluster with the desired state defined in Git and determines if they are out of sync. When it detects the environment is out of sync, Argo CD can be configured to either send out a notification to kick off a separate reconciliation process or Argo CD can automatically synchronize the environments to ensure they match. Note Confidential information like passwords and security tokens should not be checked into the Git repository. Managing secrets in Argo CD provides information on how to handle confidential information in the GitOps repo. Configuring GitOps with Argo CD \u00b6 Terminology: Argo CD uses a number of terms to refer to the components Application - A deployable unit In the context of the environment, an application is one Helm chart that contains one container image that was produced by one CI pipeline. While Helm charts and images could certainly be combined to make more sophisticated applications in more advanced scenarios, we will be using this simple definition here. Project - A collection of applications that make up a solution Set up the GitOps repo \u00b6 Todo Is this better in the developer setup section? Argo CD uses a Git repo to express the desired state of the Kubernetes environment. The basic setup uses one repository to represent one project . Within that repository, each application that makes up the project will be described in its own folder. The repository will also contain a branch for each destination (i.e. cluster and namespace) into which we want to deploy the applications. Note There is nothing special about a git repository used for git-ops. All that is required at a minimum is a hosted git repository that is accessible from by the Argo CD instance. The Argo CD Starter Kit used in the following steps is optional and provides some application templates to help simplify some configuration activities. Create a new repo from the Argo CD Starter Kit https://github.com/IBM/template-argocd-gitops/generate . click Use this template - If you see a 404 error when you click on the link, you need to sign in to github. Clone the project to your machine git clone ${ GIT_URL_GITOPS } navigate into the directory cd ${ GIT_DIRECTORY } Create and push test branch git checkout -b test git push -u origin test Hook the CI pipeline to the CD pipeline \u00b6 The last stage in the CI pipeline updates a GitOps repository with the updated application metadata from the build. In order to do that, the CI pipeline needs to know which repository should be used and needs the credentials to push changes to that repository. As with other configuration within the pipeline, this is handled with config maps and secrets: A secret named git-credentials holds the credentials the CI pipeline uses to access all the repositories in the Git host (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, etc. If you used the Toolkit CLI to register the pipeline then this secret has already been created. A config map named gitops-repo holds the url and branch for the gitops repository. Fortunately the Toolkit CLI provides a gitops command to simplify this step. Information on how to use the command as well as the alternative manual steps can be found in the Toolkit CLI gitops command section. Make sure to switch context to the project/namespace CI namespace oc project ${ DEV_NAMESPACE } Run the gitops command to create the config map and secret in the CI namespace igc gitops Note For the secret to be available to the CI pipeline, the secret needs to be created in the same namespace where the pipeline is running. The value provided for branch is the one the pipeline will use to when committing changes to trigger the CD pipeline. As of v2.0.0 of the Tekton tasks and the Jenkins pipelines, the CI pipeline will create a folder and the initial configuration for an application deployment if it doesn't already exist. This means, there is no other manual configuration required to set up the repository. Now run a new Pipeline and make sure a directory for the application is created on the gitops git repository. This is required before configuring ArgoCD. Configure Release namespaces \u00b6 ArgoCD will deploy the application into the \"releases\" namespace such as ${TEST_NAMESPACE} or ${STAGING_NAMESPACE} Create a release namespace where ArgoCD will deploy the application oc new-project ${ TEST_NAMESPACE } The release namespaces need pull secrets for the application container images to be pull. OpenShift Image Registry If you are using the OpenShift Image Registry then you need to give permission to the services accounts in the \"release\" namespaces to be able to pull images from the \"development\" namespaces. Grant access to service accounts in the new test or staging namespace to pull the container image from the dev namespace oc policy add-role-to-group system:image-puller system:serviceaccounts: { TEST_NAMESPACE } -n { DEV_NAMESPACE } IBM Container Registry If you are using the IBM Container Registry then you need to copy the pull secret all-icr-io from the default namespace and then add this secret to the service account used by your application (ie default service account) Use the Toolkit CLI to copy the secret and setup the service account igc pull-secret ${ TEST_NAMESPACE } -t default -z default Other Container Registries If you are using an external image registry from a 3rd party provider like quay.io or dockerhub.io then you need to create the pull secret of type \"docker-registry\" and add it to the service account. Check the OpenShift Documentation Using pull secrets Register the GitOps repo in ArgoCD \u00b6 Now that the repository has been created, we need to tell ArgoCD where it is. Log into ArgoCD Click on the gear icon on the left menu to access the Settings options Select the Repositories option Click either the Connect Repo using HTTPS or Connect Repo using SSH button at the top and provide the information for the GitOps repo you just created. For HTTPS you can use the access token you used when you ran igc gitops Create a project in Argo CD \u00b6 In Argo CD terms, each deployable component is an application and applications are grouped into projects. Projects are not required for Argo CD to be able to deploy applications, but it helps to organize applications and provide some restrictions on what can be done for applications that make up a project.

The plugin takes yaml configuration as input, looks up the credentials in Key Protect, and generates a secret in the cluster from the results. Note If Argo CD was installed via the Toolkit then the plugin should already be installed and ready to use. If not, the instructions for installing the plugin can be found in the plugin documentation . Prepare the Key Protect instance \u00b6 As the name suggests, the Argo CD Key Protect plugin leverages the capabilities of the Key Protect service to manage the protected information. The details for setting up and managing the Key Protect instance can be found in Secret management with Key Protect . From those instructions you can find the information required for the subsequent steps. Create the secret configuration \u00b6 The input to the plugin is a directory that contains one or more yaml \"secret templates\". In this case the \"secret template\" provides the structure of the desired secret with placeholders for the values that will be pulled from the key management system. Create a directory to contain the secret configuration. The Argo CD Starter Kit repository has a template in templates/secrets-plugin that can be copied as a starting point Update the values in the yaml file for the secret that will be created apiVersion : keymanagement.ibm/v1 kind : SecretTemplate metadata : name : mysecret annotations : key-manager : key-protect key-protect/instanceId : instance-id key-protect/region : us-east spec : labels : {} annotations : {} values : - name : url value : https://ibm.com - name : username b64value : dGVhbS1jYXA= - name : password keyId : 36397b07-d98d-4c0b-bd7a-d6c290163684 The metadata.annotations value is optional. key-manager - the only value supported currently is key-protect key-protect/instanceId - the instance id of the key protect instance. If not provided then the instance-id value from the key-protect-access secret will be used. key-protect/region - the region where the key protect instance has been provisioned. If not provided then the region value from the key-protect-access secret will be used. The metadata.name value given will be used as the name for the Secret that will be generated. The information in spec.labels and spec.annotations will be copied over as the labels and annotations in the Secret that is generated The spec.values section contains the information that should be provided in the data section of the generated Secret. There are three possible ways the values can be provided: value - the actual value can be provided directly as clear text. This would be appropriate for information that is not sensitive but is required in the secret b64value - a base64 encoded value can be provided to the secret. This can be used for large values that might present formatting issues or for information that is not sensitive but that might be obfuscated a bit (like a username) keyId - the id (not the name) of the Standard Key that has been stored in Key Protect. The value stored in Key Protect can be anything Commit the changes to the GitOps repository Add the secret application in Argo CD \u00b6 Once the configuration has been added to the GitOps repository, Argo CD needs to be configured to deploy the secrets.

The instructions below will show you how to do it. You can create a new app using one of the Starter Kits . These have been created to include all the key components, configuration, and frameworks to get you started on creating the code you need for your solutions. The approach for getting started is exactly the same for an environment based on Kubernetes or Red Hat OpenShift . Note The instructions provided below lean heavily on the use of the IGC Command Line Interface (CLI) tool, to both show how the CLI works in context and to streamline the process (the reason for creating the CLI in the first place). However, the use of the CLI is in no way required to use the Cloud-Native Toolkit. If you would prefer to work through these instructions without the use of the CLI, we have provided the equivalent manual steps for each command on the Cloud-Native Toolkit CLI page. The video below (click to play the video) demonstrates how to work through the steps to create an application and use a deployment pipeline to install it into your development cluster. Create an application \u00b6 1. Log into your Development Cluster from the command line \u00b6 Before starting, make sure you have set up your development tools . Cluster managed by IBM Cloud Log into the cluster with icc [cluster name|cluster nickname] OpenShift cluster Run oc login $SERVER -u $OCP_USERNAME -p $OCP_PASSWORD You should now be able to access the OpenShift console: oc console Note If your workshop is on Code Ready Workspaces, follow the steps in Code Ready Workspaces Setup before logging in to the cluster. The remaining steps assume this step has already been performed. If you stop and then come back later it is a good idea to re-run this step again before proceeding 2. Create the development namespace \u00b6 Before getting started, the development namespace/project needs to be created and prepared for the DevOps pipelines. This is something that would typically happen once at the beginning of a project when a development team is formed and assigned to the cluster. This step copies the common secrets and configMaps that contain the CI/CD configuration from the tools namespace into the development namespace/project. This enables the pipelines to reference the values easily for your project. oc sync ${ DEV_NAMESPACE } 3. Open the Developer Dashboard \u00b6 The Developer Dashboard makes it easy for you to navigate to the tools, including a section that allows you to select a set of pre-configured Starter Kits that make seeding your development project very easy. Before starting, open a browser and make sure you are logged into Github . There are two options for how to access the dashboard: OpenShift console Open the Application Launcher dropdown from the top-right and select Developer Dashboard Command Line oc dashboard 4. Create your app in Git \u00b6 Warning If you are developing on a shared education cluster, you need to make it easy to identify your app. Please suffix the app name with your initials {app name}-{your initials} (e.g. stockbffnode-mjp ) and use the Git Organization for the shared environment. Warning Your browser needs to be logged in to your GitHub account for a template to work. If the link from the tile displays the GitHub 404 page, log in and reload the page. From the Developer Dashboard, click on Starter Kits tab Pick one of the templates that is a good architectural fit for your application and the language and framework that you prefer to work with. For your first application, select the Typescript Microservice . This also works well in the Cloud Shell. Click on a Starter Kit Tile to create your app github repository from the template repository selected. You can also click on the Git Icon to browse the source template repository and click on the Template to create the template. Complete the GitHub create repository from template process. Owner : Select a valid GitHub organization that you are authorized to create repositories within or the one you were given for the shared cluster (See warning above) Repository name : Enter a name for your repo. GitHub will help with showing a green tick if it is valid (See warning above) Description : Describe your app Press Create repository from template The new repository will be created in your selected organization. Create the DevOps pipeline \u00b6 5. Register the application in a DevOps Pipeline \u00b6 Info We will be using the pipeline command of the IBM Garage Cloud cli to register the DevOps pipeline. The pipeline command gives an option for both Jenkins and Tekton . For more information about working with the different build engines, please see Continuous Integration with Jenkins Guide and Continuous Integration with Tekton Guide Open a browser to the Git repository created in the previous step. Copy the url to the Git repository. For GitHub this is done by pressing the Code button and copying the url provided in the Clone section. Start the process to create a pipeline. oc pipeline ${ GIT_URL } For example: oc pipeline https://github.com/gct-showcase/inventory-svc For the deployment of your first app with OpenShift select Tekton as the CI engine. The first time a pipeline is registered in the namespace, the CLI will ask for a username and Password / Personal Access Token for the Git repository that will be stored in a secret named git-credentials . Username : Enter your GitHub user id Personal Access Token : Paste your GitHub personal access token When registering a Tekton pipeline, the CLI will attempt to determine the runtime used by the repository that was provided and filter the available pipelines. If only one matches then it will be automatically selected. If it cannot find a match or there is more than one match then you will be prompted to select the pipeline. When registering a Tekton pipeline, the CLI also reads the available parameters from the pipeline and generates prompts for input. In this case, the option of scanning the built image for vulnerabilities is the only options. The scan is performed by the Vulnerability Advisor if you are using IBM Image Registry or by Trivy if another image registry is used. This scan is performed in \"scan\" stage of pipeline after \"img-release\" stage. ? scan-image: Enable the pipeline to scan the image for vulnerabilities? ( Y/n ) To skip the scan, you have type \"n\" (No).Otherwise, type \"y\" (Yes) for performing Vulnerability Scanning on the image. After the pipeline has been created,the command will set up a webhook from the Git host to the pipeline event listener. Note if the webhook registration step fails, it is likely because the Git credentials are incorrect or do not have enough permission in the repository. When the command is completed it will present options for next steps. You can use the Tekton cli commands to inspect the pipeline run that has been created and tail the log and/or navigate to the provided url to see the pipeline running from the OpenShift console. 6. View your application pipeline \u00b6 The steps to view your registered pipeline will vary based on type of pipeline ( Jenkins or Tekton ) and container platform version. Tekton OpenShift 4.x Open the OpenShift Web Console oc console OR From menu on the left switch to the Developer mode Select dev project that was used for the application pipeline registration In the left menu, select Pipelines You will see your application DevOps pipeline now starting to build and once completed will look like the image below. Kubernetes Open the Developer Dashboard kubectl dashboard Select the Tekton tile to launch the Tekton UI Select your development project Jenkins OpenShift 4.x Open the OpenShift Web Console oc console OR From the left-hand menu, select Builds -> Build Configs Select your project from the drop-down menu at the top The registered pipeline should appear in the list Kubernetes Run the command oc dashboard in your terminal to open your Developer Dashboard Select the Jenkins tool to open the Jenkins dashboard Run the command kubectl credentials in your terminal to get the list of logins for the tools Use the Jenkins userid and password to log into the Jenkins dashboard Wait for the pipeline stages to start building. Once the stages have completed, you will see a view similar to the one below. 7. View your application artifacts \u00b6 Todo What happens if the cluster is not running on IBM Cloud - registry? The pipeline built two artifacts for deploying your app: Container image -- The image registry includes a container image with your app built in Helm chart -- The artifact repository includes a Helm chart repository that includes a Helm chart for deploying your app Let's look at these artifacts in the Toolkit environment. The container image is stored in the IBM Cloud Container Registry: From the OpenShift console's tools menu or from the Developer Dashboard's tools page, select Image Registry. In the image registry, you'll see the image the pipeline built for your app, such as us.icr.io/isv-scenarios/stockbffnode-bw with a different tag for each build. The Helm chart is stored in Artifactory: From the OpenShift console's tools menu or from the Developer Dashboard's tools page, select Artifactory. In the Artifactory console, select Artifactory > Artifacts > generic-local. You'll see a isv-scenarios folder with a different chart for each build, such as generic-local/isv-scenarios/stockbffnode-bw-0.0.1.tgz . 8. Access the running app \u00b6 Once the pipeline has completed successfully, the app will be deployed into the namespace used when registering the pipeline. To validate the app is running follow these steps: Note Be sure the namespace context is set correctly before running the following commands Retrieve the app ingress endpoint using commands below in your terminal. oc endpoints From the endpoints listed, select the URL for the repo that was just deployed and press Enter to open that URL in a web browser. Validate the application is working as expected. 9. Locate the app in the web console \u00b6 The build pipeline is configured to build the source code from the Git repository into a container image. This image is stored in the Image Registry. After that, the image is deployed into the same namespace/project within the development cluster where the pipeline ran and validated for its health. The steps below will walk through locating the installed application within the Web Console. OpenShift 4.x Open the OpenShift web console oc console Change to the Developer view Click on Topology menu Click on your application deployment in the topology view Click on the Overview tab Increase the number of running pods to 2 pods Click on the Resources tab to view the list of pods Click on View Logs link to view the logs from each pod You can see the running state of your application Kubernetes Open the Kubernetes Dashboard kubectl console Change to the namespace from default to either dev or the namespace you used to deploy your app Click on Deployments You should see the deployment of your application Click on your application , and the corresponding Replica Set Try scaling the application, click on Scale in the header, change number of pods to 2 and click OK Click on one of the pod instances Click on Logs You can see the running state of your application Navigate around the console to understand where your deployment, service and pods are running Success You now have your application running inside your development cluster and being delivered using a Tekton based CI pipeline. This is the beginning of the developer journey with IBM Cloud. Having reached this point, we recommend you repeat the process a few more times using different Code Patterns templates and explore the Developer view in OpenShift to get familiar with it. Run the application locally \u00b6 10. Clone your code to you local machine \u00b6 Open a browser to the Git repository created in the previous step. Copy the url to the Git repository. For GitHub this is done by pressing the Code button and copying the url provided in the Clone section. Clone the repository using the url from the terminal. git clone ${ GIT_URL } For example: git clone https://github.com/gct-showcase/inventory-svc You will be required to enter your GitHub User ID and use your Git Hub Personal Access Token as your password. This will complete the clone of your git repository. Change into the cloned directory cd stockbffnode 11. Run the application locally \u00b6 Most developers like to run the code natively in local development environment. To do so, follow the instructions listed in the README.md file to run the code locally. You may be required to install a specific runtime like Java , Node or Go . If you want to quickly access your git repo you can run a helper command to open the git webpage. oc git From inside the folder where the code was cloned from GitHub, run the following command to install the Node.js dependencies. npm install Run the following command to start the application. npm run start Cloud Shell To view the running app click on the Eye Icon on the top right and select the port 3000 this will open a browser tab and display the running app on that port. Cloud Ready Workspaces Click on open link To view this application in new tab click top right corner arrow icon Desktop/Laptop Open a browser to http://localhost:3000/api-docs/ You can try out the sample API that is provided with this Code Pattern You can now add new features and function from inside the Cloud Shell and experiment with your code before you push any changes back to git. 12. Test the webhook \u00b6 Go to your cloned git project and navigate to chart/base directory. cd stockbffnode cd chart/base Open the file Chart.yaml in edit mode and change the description field's value from \"A Helm chart for Kubernetes\" to \"A Helm chart for [yourprojectName]\" Save the edits Push the changes back to your repository git add . git commit -m \"Update application name\" git push As soon as you push your code changes successfully, the webhook will trigger a new pipeline run for your project in your namespace in OCP. Note if the webhook registration step failed, the git push will not trigger the pipeline.","title":"Continuous Integration"},{"location":"learning/fast-ci/#continuous-integration-fast-start","text":"","title":"Continuous Integration - fast start"},{"location":"learning/fast-ci/#overview","text":"The environment supports end-to-end development and deployment of an application.

It embodies IBM Garage Method principles and practices for consistently developed applications, incorporating best practices that increase developer velocity for efficient delivery of business value. Cloud-Native Toolkit objectives \u00b6 There are a number of objectives behind providing the Cloud-Native Toolkit. The three main goals of the Toolkit are provided below: 1. Accelerate time to business value \u00b6 One goal of the Cloud-Native Toolkit is to prepare the development environment quickly and allow the development team to start delivering business function on day one of the first iteration using enterprise cloud-native practices. After all, the point of cloud-native development is to deliver business value to end users and the development and operations infrastructure are provided in service to that goal. Through the automation provided by the Cloud-Native Toolkit we can provision an environment in minutes through automation that is fully configured and ready for a development team to start working immediately. With the other components of the Toolkit, developers can begin with a rich DevOps framework with a focus on \"build to manage\" techniques to help build production-ready applications. 2. Reduce risk through consistent delivery models from start to production \u00b6 The Cloud-Native Toolkit encapsulates many of the available best practices for cloud-native development including DevOps and \"Build to Manage\" practices. They have been provided through the Toolkit in this way so that developers and site reliability engineers (SREs) can benefit from these practices without requiring any additional effort and so that they can be applied consistently from project to project. 3. Quickly ramp up development teams on Red Hat OpenShift and Kubernetes \u00b6 Containerized platforms like Red Hat OpenShift and Kubernetes provide a great deal of functionality and flexibility for application teams. However, these platforms can at time seem unapproachable for developers and SREs new to the environment given all the different concepts and components. The Cloud-Native Toolkit aims to help with the learning curve in two different ways: Provide tools and techniques to \"round off the corners\" of the more complex aspects of working in a containerized environment Provide a learning journey that incrementally introduces the concepts of a containerized environment in terms of practical scenarios, not abstract theory Guided walk-though \u00b6 If you'd like to have a guided walk through of what the Cloud-Native Toolkit provides, check out this video demonstration of the Toolkit in action: Components of the Cloud-Native Toolkit \u00b6 As the name suggests, the Cloud-Native Toolkit provides a collection of tools that can be used in part or in whole to support the activities of software development life-cycle. The following provides a listing of the assets that make up the Cloud-Native Toolkit: Guides - this set of documentation that weaves the various toolkit components together with a perspective on how to apply cloud-native practices to deliver business solutions Infrastructure as Code - Terraform scripts and GitOps configuration to provision and manage the environment CLI - a simple node-based CLI that installs as a plugin to the kubectl and oc CLIs and provides commands to simplify common Developer Dashboard - Dashboard component and Red Hat OpenShift console extensions to simplify common developer activities DevOps pipelines - continuous integration pipelines for Tekton and Jenkins Starter Kits and Code Patterns - software repositories that can be used to quickly get started building applications using common patterns, or to serve as a reference to enhance existing patterns Learning Journey - activation material to teach practitioners how to apply cloud-native practices in real-world scenarios using the Toolkit Cloud-Native Toolkit Developer Environment \u00b6 The Cloud-Native Toolkit Developer Environment includes several features that support IBM Garage Method best practices for consistent and rapid development of cloud-native applications: Cluster : A Red Hat OpenShift or Kubernetes cluster that both hosts the tools and itself is a deployment target for application builds Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) : Deployment target environments that support the application development lifecycle: dev , test , and staging Backend services : Cloud services commonly required by cloud-native applications for monitoring, security, and persistence CI/CD : A prebuilt, ready-to-run continuous delivery pipeline incorporating best-of-breed open source software tools Starter Kits : Prebuilt code templates for common application components and tasks incorporating best practices that developers can add to their codebase as needed Dashboard : A centralized console to help developers use the environment's capabilities Typically a Cloud System Admin installs and sets up a new Developer Environment after the inception workshop , providing a place for the developers to start developing the minimum viable product (MVP) . The objective is to reduce the time required for a team to configure and prepare their development environment. The key benefit is to make the end-to-end CI/CD development lifecycle consistent across each platform and make the out-of-the-box developer experience as simple as possible. The installation is performed using Terraform scripts structured as modular components so unneeded tools can be easily disabled or new tools added. The combination of tools selected are proven in the industry to deliver real value for modern cloud-native development. Red Hat Open Innovation Labs CI/CD components embodies a very similar approach to how they deliver success with OpenShift. Environment components \u00b6 After installation, the environment consists of the following components and developer tools: A Red Hat OpenShift or IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service development cluster A collection of continuous delivery tools deployed into the cluster A set of backend services This diagram illustrates the environment: The diagram shows the components in the environment: the cluster, the deployment target environments, the cloud services, and the tools.

Previously it did that by trying to list all the pods in the cluster (e.g. the equivalent of kubectl get pods -A ). Unfortunately, that command needs a great deal of access to succeed. The check was changed to run a command that requires much less permission. Before creating the webhook triggers, the pipeline command would read the Tekton version number from annotations on the operator deployment in the openshift-operators namespace. This check required a great deal of permissions to be able to read the deployment in that namespace. Instead, the pipeline command has been changed to resort to a brute force check - it assumes v0.6.0 and if it fails tries again with v0.4.0. Usability updates for pipeline command Allows the repo url to be passed in so it is not necessary to clone the repository first Creates a single event listener per namespace/project instead of a new event listener for each repo Detects the runtime of the repository and filters the tekton pipelines based on the runtime Reads params from tekton pipeline and prompts for values The input arguments have been cleaned up to remove conflicts and to use values that make more sense for the input parameters.

For example, all of the following are equivalent: igc pipeline kubectl pipeline oc pipeline Prerequisite tools \u00b6 Some of the commands provided by the Toolkit CLI orchestrate interactions between other CLIs. To get started please install the prerequisite tools , in particular: The Kubernetes CLI The Red Hat OpenShift CLI The IBM Cloud CLI - used to interact with IBM Cloud vlans (not needed if tools will not run on IBM Cloud) Available commands \u00b6 dashboard \u00b6 Opens the Developer Dashboard in the default browser. If a default browser has not been configured, then the URL to the Dashboard will be printed out. The dashboard displays the Cloud-Native Toolkit tools configured within the cluster along with links to activation content and links to Starter Kits to start a project quickly. This command requires that the login context for the cluster has already been established. Command flags \u00b6 -n : the namespace where the dashboard has been deployed; the default is tools Usage \u00b6 CLI The command is used in the following way: igc dashboard OpenShift The following commands would have the same result on OpenShift: HOST = $( oc get routes/dashboard -n tools -o jsonpath = '{.spec.host}' ) open \"https:// $HOST \" Kubernetes The following commands would have the same result on Kubernetes: HOST = $( kubectl get ingress/developer-dashboard -n tools -o jsonpath = '{.spec.rules[0].host}' ) open \"https:// $HOST \" Related commands \u00b6 credentials : shows information about the same tools shown in the dashboard from the command-line tool-config : allows configuration for additional tools to be added to the cluster, making them available to the dashboard and credentials command console \u00b6 Opens the IKS or OpenShift admin console in the default browser. If a default browser has not been configured, then the URL to the console will be printed out. This command requires that the login context for the cluster has already been established. Usage \u00b6 CLI The command is used in the following way: igc console OpenShift The following commands would have the same result on OpenShift: open $( oc whoami --show-console ) Kubernetes The following commands would have the same result on Kubernetes: REGION = \"...\" CLUSTER_NAME = \"...\" CLUSTER_ID = $( ibmcloud ks cluster get --cluster ${ CLUSTER_NAME } | grep -E \"^ID\" | sed -E \"s/ID: +([^ ]+)/\\\\1/g\" ) open \"https:// ${ REGION } .containers.cloud.ibm.com/kubeproxy/clusters/ ${ CLUSTER_ID } /service/#/overview?namespace=default\" Related commands \u00b6 credentials : shows information about the same tools shown in the dashboard from the command-line tool-config : allows configuration for additional tools to be added to the cluster, making them available to the dashboard and credentials command git \u00b6 Opens the Git repo in the default browser for the current working directory. If a default browser has not been configured, then the URL to the repo will be printed out. Usage \u00b6 CLI The command is used in the following way: igc git If you have multiple remotes and would like to open one other than origin : igc git origin-fork Manual The following commands would have the same result with shell commands: alias gh = \"open https://github. $( git config remote.origin.url | cut -f2 -d. | tr ':' / ) \" Related commands \u00b6 credentials : shows information about the same tools shown in the dashboard from the command-line tool-config : allows configuration for additional tools to be added to the cluster, making them available to the dashboard and credentials command credentials \u00b6 Lists the endpoints, user names, and passwords for the tools configured in the environment. This is the easiest way to get the login credentials for each of the installed tools. Ideally all of the tools would be accessible via SSO at which point this command will be obsolete. The command works by reading information available in the cluster. When each tool is installed by the toolkit, a config map and secret are created to store the url and credential for the tool. That information is used in a number of different ways within the environment: Provide configuration information to the pipelines Populate the tiles on the Developer Dashboard Populate the results of the credentials command This command requires that the login context for the cluster has already been established. Command flags \u00b6 -n : the namespace where the tools have been deployed; the default is tools Usage \u00b6 CLI The command is used in the following way: igc credentials The credential output is JSON format like this Credentials: { argocd: { user: 'admin' , password: '12345678' , url: 'https://argocd-tools.mycluster.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud' } , . . . dashboard: { url: 'https://dashboard-tools.mycluster.us-east.containers.appdomain.cloud' } , . . . } OpenShift or Kubernetes The following commands have the same result (note the dependency on jq ): # config maps kubectl get configmap -n tools -l grouping = garage-cloud-native-toolkit -o json | \\ jq '[.items[] | select(.metadata.name != \"ibmcloud-config\").data]' # secrets kubectl get secret -n tools -l grouping = garage-cloud-native-toolkit -o json | \\ jq '[.items[] | select(.metadata.name != \"ibmcloud-apikey\").data | with_entries(.value |= @base64d)]' Related commands \u00b6 dashboard : displays the url of the Developer Dashboard and launches the default browser tool-config : allows configuration for additional tools to be added to the cluster, making them available to the dashboard and credentials command endpoints \u00b6 Lists the ingress and/or route URLs for the applications in a given namespace. An attempt will be made to get the namespace from the current context if one is not provided as an argument. Results of the command are provided in an interactive menu. If one of the endpoints is selected, it will display the URL and launch it in the default browser. Selecting Exit will print the full list of endpoints and exit. This command requires that the login context for the cluster has already been established. Command flags \u00b6 -n : the namespace from which the endpoints will be read; the value will be read from the current context if not provided Usage \u00b6 CLI The command is used in the following way: igc endpoints OpenShift The following commands list the route and ingress endpoints: # routes kubectl get route -n tools # ingress kubectl get ingress -n tools Kubernetes The following commands list the ingress endpoints: kubectl get ingress -n tools sync \u00b6 Creates a Kubernetes namespace or OpenShift project (if it doesn't already exist) and sets it up so that the namespace can be used as a target for application deployments and/or to host the environment. The command synchronize the ConfigMaps and Secrets from a template namespace (ie tools ) to create a \"development\" namespace. After the command has run successfully it will set the provided namespace in the current context (e.g. equivalent to oc project X ) This command copies the relevant ConfigMaps and Secrets into the namespace that are needed for development activities. Managing resources across namespaces (particularly ConfigMaps and Secrets ) is a common challenge in Kubernetes environments. We have provided the command at this time to simplify the steps required to get everything ready. Ultimately, this problem seems like an ideal one for an Operator to solve and when one is available (either from the Toolkit or elsewhere) this command will be retired or transitioned. The command will setup the \"development\" namespace where DevOps pipelines can be run (e.g. myapp-dev) The \"development\" namespace will have the ConfigMaps and Secrets copied over. Positionals: namespace The namespace that will be created and/or prepared Options: --version Show version number [boolean] --help Show help [boolean] -t, --templateNamespace the template namespace that will be the source of the config [string] [default: \"tools\"] -z, --serviceAccount the service account that will be used within the namespace [string] [default: \"default\"] --verbose flag to produce more verbose logging [boolean] Usage \u00b6 CLI Create a dev namespace for development igc sync myapp-dev OpenShift Create a dev namespace for development oc sync myapp-dev Kubernetes Create a dev namespace for development kubectl sync myapp-dev Manual ConfigMap and Secret setup The following steps will copy the ConfigMaps and Secrets from a template namespace to a target namespace: export TEMPLATE_NAMESPACE = \"tools\" export NAMESPACE = \"NAMESPACE\" kubectl get configmap -l group = catalyst-tools -n ${ TEMPLATE_NAMESPACE } -o jsonpath = '{ range .items[*] }{ .metadata.name }{ \"\\n\" }{ end }' | \\ while read cm ; do kubectl get configmap ${ cm } --namespace ${ TEMPLATE_NAMESPACE } --export -o yaml | \\ kubectl apply --namespace $NAMESPACE -f - done kubectl get secret -l group = catalyst-tools -n ${ TEMPLATE_NAMESPACE } -o jsonpath = '{ range .items[*] }{ .metadata.name }{ \"\\n\" }{ end }' | \\ while read cm ; do kubectl get secret ${ cm } --namespace ${ TEMPLATE_NAMESPACE } --export -o yaml | \\ kubectl apply --namespace $NAMESPACE -f - done pull-secret \u00b6 Copy pull secrets into the provided project from the template namespace for the IBM Container Registry. Set up a service account in the namespace with the pull secret(s) for the IBM Container Registry that are copied. The pull secret(s) are required in order for pods to pull images that are stored in the IBM Container Registry. When the cluster is created in IBM Cloud, a pull secret is provided in the default namespace. In order for a pod in another namespace to use it, the secret must first be copied into the namespace. After that, the pod either needs to reference the pull secret directly or the service account used by the resource needs to have a reference to the secret. The CLI copies the pull secret over and adds it to the service account so the pod can take either approach. This command should be use to set up \"release\" namespaces where applications can be deployed (e.g. test, staging) Positionals: namespace The namespace into which the pull-secret(s) will be created Options: --version Show version number [boolean] --help Show help [boolean] -t, --templateNamespace the template namespace that will be the source of the config [string] [default: \"tools\"] -z, --serviceAccount the service account that will be used within the namespace [string] [default: \"default\"] --dev flag to indicate this is a development namespace and that development artifacts should be created[boolean] --verbose flag to produce more verbose logging [boolean] Usage \u00b6 CLI Copy the pull secret from default namespace into myapp-test namespace and add to serviceAccount default igc pull-secret myapp-test -t default -z default Manual pull secret setup The following commands will copy the pull secret(s) from the default namespace and add them to the service account: export NAMESPACE = \"myapp-test\" export SERVICE_ACCOUNT = \"default\" if [[ $( kubectl get secrets -n \" ${ NAMESPACE } \" -o jsonpath = '{ range .items[*] }{ .metadata.name }{ \"\\n\" }{ end }' | grep icr | wc -l | xargs ) -eq 0 ]] ; then echo \"*** Copying pull secrets from default namespace to ${ NAMESPACE } namespace\" kubectl get secrets -n default | grep icr | sed \"s/\\([A-Za-z-]*\\) *.*/\\1/g\" | while read default_secret ; do kubectl get secret ${ default_secret } -n default -o yaml --export | sed \"s/name: default-/name: /g\" | kubectl -n ${ NAMESPACE } create -f - done else echo \"*** Pull secrets already exist on ${ NAMESPACE } namespace\" fi EXISTING_SECRETS = $( kubectl get serviceaccount/ ${ SERVICE_ACCOUNT } -n \" ${ NAMESPACE } \" -o json | tr '\\n' ' ' | sed -E \"s/.*imagePullSecrets.: \\[([^]]*)\\].*/\\1/g\" | grep icr | wc -l | xargs ) if [[ ${ EXISTING_SECRETS } -eq 0 ]] ; then echo \"*** Adding secrets to serviceaccount/ ${ SERVICE_ACCOUNT } in ${ NAMESPACE } namespace\" PULL_SECRETS = $( kubectl get secrets -n \" ${ NAMESPACE } \" -o jsonpath = '{ range .items[*] }{ \"{\\\"name\\\": \\\"\"}{ .metadata.name }{ \"\\\"}\\n\" }{ end }' | grep icr | grep -v \" ${ NAMESPACE } \" | paste -sd \",\" - ) kubectl patch -n \" ${ NAMESPACE } \" serviceaccount/ ${ SERVICE_ACCOUNT } -p \"{\\\"imagePullSecrets\\\": [ ${ PULL_SECRETS } ]}\" else echo \"*** Pull secrets already applied to serviceaccount/ ${ SERVICE_ACCOUNT } in ${ NAMESPACE } namespace\" fi pipeline \u00b6 Connects a branch in a Git repo to a either a Jenkins or Tekton CI pipeline in the environment and triggers an initial build. A webhook is also created so that when a new commit is added to the branch, the pipeline is triggered to start the process to rebuild and redeploy the app using the new code. Currently, webhook creation is supported for repositories hosted on Gitlab, Github, Github Enterprise, Bitbucket, and Gogs. This command can either be used to register a git repository that has previously been cloned to the local filesystem OR using the remote repo url. Repository location \u00b6 The pipeline command supports registering a CI pipeline for a repository that has been cloned locally or using the remote repository url. Local repository \u00b6 If you are registering a local repository then you must run the command from within the directory of your local clone of the Git repo. When registering a local repository, the pipeline will use the branch that is currently checked out. Remote repository \u00b6 To register a remote repository, pass the repo url as an argument to the pipeline command. For example: oc pipeline \"https://github.com/my-org/my-repo\" You can optionally provide the branch name with the url using a hash ( # ): oc pipeline \"https://github.com/my-org/my-repo#my-branch\" Note When registering a remote git repo, if the branch is not provided then the default branch will be used. Pipeline type \u00b6 The pipeline command supports registering pipelines with either Tekton or Jenkins. The pipeline can be specified from the command-line with either the --tekton or --jenkins flags. If a flag is not provided then you will be prompted to select the pipeline. Git credentials \u00b6 The command will prompt for the username and password/personal access token to access the Git repository, unless those are already stored in a secret in the cluster namespace or provided as command-line parameters. The username and password can be provided with the -u and -p flags. If you want to change the credentials that have already been stored in the cluster namespace, the -g argument an be provided and you will be prompted for the credentials. Tekton template pipeline \u00b6 If a Tekton pipeline will be used, a template pipeline must be selected for the new repository pipeline. The command reads the template pipelines available in the template namespace. The template namespace can be provided with the -t argument and will default to tools if not provided. The command will also filter the list of pipelines based on the runtime determined from the given repository. If there is more than one template pipeline available then you will be prompted to pick one. The template pipeline can also be provided on the command-line using the --pipeline argument. If the name doesn't match an available pipeline then you will be prompted to select one. Pipeline parameters \u00b6 Once the pipeline template is selected, you will be prompted to provide values for the defined pipeline parameters. The values can also be provided from the command-line using the -p argument. The name of the parameter is listed at the beginning of the prompt message. Multiple parameters can be provided by repeating the -p argument. For example: oc pipeline --tekton \"https://github.com/my-org/my-repo\" -p scan-image = false -p edge = false Optional arguments \u00b6 -u : the username for accessing the Git repo -P : the password or personal access token for accessing the Git repo -g : ignore existing git-credentials secret and prompt to update the values -p : provide parameters for the pipeline --jenkins : deploy using a Jenkins pipeline --tekton : deploy using a Tekton pipeline --pipeline : the name of the Tekton pipeline -n : the deployment namespace; if not provided the namespace from the current context will be used -t : the template namespace; if not provided the value will default to tools Usage CLI Create a Jenkins pipeline in the current namespace and prompt for the Git credentials oc pipeline --jenkins Create a Tekton pipeline in the my-dev namespace, using the Git credentials gituser and gitpat oc pipeline -n my-dev -u gituser -P gitpat --tekton Manual Steps for Tekton The following is the list of steps required to manually configure a Tekton pipeline with your development cluster. Set the current namespace/project OpenShift oc project { namespace } Kubernetes kubectl config set-context --current --namespace ={ namespace } Copy the tasks from the tools namespace into the current namespace kubectl get tasks -o json -n tools | \\ jq 'del(.items[].metadata.uid) | del(.items[].metadata.selfLink) | del(.items[].metadata.resourceVersion) | del(.items[].metadata.namespace) | del(.items[].metadata.creationTimestamp) | del(.items[].metadata.generation) | del(.items[].metadata.annotations.\"kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration\")' | \\ kubectl apply -f - List the available pipeline templates in the tools namespace and select the one to use for your project. kubectl get pipelines -n tools Clone the selected pipeline from the tools namespace into the current namespace kubectl get pipeline ${ TEMPLATE_NAME } -o json -n tools | \\ jq --arg PIPELINE_NAME ${ PIPELINE_NAME } '.metadata.name = $PIPELINE_NAME | del(.metadata.uid) | del(.metadata.selfLink) | del(.metadata.resourceVersion) | del(.metadata.namespace) | del(.metadata.creationTimestamp) | del(.metadata.generation) | del(.metadata.annotations.\"kubectl.kubernetes.io/last-applied-configuration\")' | \\ kubectl apply -f - where: - TEMPLATE_NAME is the name of the pipeline selected in the previous step - PIPELINE_NAME is the name of the pipeline for your project Start the pipeline \u00b6 The Tekton pipeline does not automatically start when it is first created. After the webhook is created in the subsequent steps the pipeline will start when changes are pushed to the repository but before that, we can manually trigger the build to start using the CLI. (The pipeline can also be started through the OpenShift Console.) Kick off the pipeline using the Tekton CLI tkn pipeline start { PIPELINE_NAME } -s pipeline -p git-url ={ GIT_REPO } -p git-revision ={ GIT_BRANCH } To create a new PipelineRun with the same parameters from a previous PipelineRun you can do the following tkn pipeline start { PIPELINE_NAME } --use-pipelinerun { PIPELINE_RUN_NAME } Create a Git Webhook** \u00b6 Create the event listener and triggers \u00b6 In order for a Tekton pipeline to be triggered by a webhook notification, several resources need to be created: TriggerTemplate - defines how to create the PipelineRun and any other required resources when a webhook notification is received. TriggerBinding - provides a mapping for the information available in the webhook payload into the TriggerTemplate EventListener - makes the connection between the Pipeline, TriggerBinding, and TriggerTemplate together that will be created when a webhook is triggered Create a file named tekton-trigger.yaml and paste in the following contents: apiVersion : triggers.tekton.dev/v1alpha1 kind : TriggerTemplate metadata : labels : app : { PIPELINE_NAME } name : { TRIGGER_TEMPLATE_NAME } spec : params : - description : The git revision name : gitrevision - description : The git repository url name : gitrepositoryurl resourcetemplates : - apiVersion : tekton.dev/v1beta1 kind : PipelineRun metadata : generateName : { PIPELINE_NAME } - spec : params : - name : git-url value : $(params.gitrepositoryurl) - name : git-revision value : $(params.gitrevision) - name : scan-image value : \"false\" pipelineRef : name : { PIPELINE_NAME } --- apiVersion : triggers.tekton.dev/v1alpha1 kind : TriggerBinding metadata : labels : app : { PIPELINE_NAME } name : { TRIGGER_BINDING_NAME } spec : params : - name : gitrevision value : $(body.head_commit.id) - name : gitrepositoryurl value : $(body.repository.url) --- apiVersion : triggers.tekton.dev/v1alpha1 kind : EventListener metadata : labels : app : { PIPELINE_NAME } name : { EVENT_LISTENER_NAME } spec : serviceAccountName : pipeline triggers : - bindings : - kind : TriggerBinding name : { TRIGGER_BINDING_NAME } interceptors : - cel : filter : header.match('X-GitHub-Event', 'push') && body.ref == 'refs/heads/{BRANCH_NAME}' name : { PIPELINE_NAME } template : name : { TRIGGER_TEMPLATE_NAME } Replace the place holder values with the appropriate values: where: - {PIPELINE_NAME} is the name of your Pipeline resource from the previous section. - {TRIGGER_TEMPLATE_NAME} is the name of the TriggerTemplate. This can be the same as the {PIPELINE_NAME} . - {TRIGGER_BINDING_NAME} is the name of the TriggerBinding. This can be the same as the {PIPELINE_NAME} . - {EVENT_LISTENER_NAME} is the name of the EventListener. This can be el-{PIPELINE_NAME} if the EventListeners will be configured one-to-one with the Pipelines or the instance can be shared across the project. - {BRANCH_NAME} is the name of the branch from which webhook events should trigger the build to start Apply the trigger resources to the cluster, in the same namespace where the Pipeline was created kubectl apply -f tekton-trigger.yaml In order for the Git repository to trigger the build with a webhook, an endpoint needs to be available. Expose the EventListener service with a route to provide that endpoint. oc expose service ${ EVENT_LISTENER_NAME } --name = ${ EVENT_LISTENER_NAME } Register the webhook url with your Git repository \u00b6 The particular steps will vary to create the Webhook depending on the flavor of hosted Git you are using (GitHub, GitHub Enterprise, GitLab, BitBucket, etc) but the general flow will remain the same. Get the host name for the route created in the previous step oc get route ${ EVENT_LISTENER_NAME } -o jsonpath = '{.spec.host}' Create a webhook in your hosted Git repository using the https url of the host name from the previous step that is triggered by the desired events (e.g. push, pull request, release) Manual steps for Jenkins on OpenShift Provision Jenkins ephemeral \u00b6 Jenkins ephemeral provides a kubernetes native version of Jenkins that dynamically provisions build agents on-demand. It's ephemeral meaning it doesn't allocate any persistent storage in the cluster. Set the project/namespace oc project { NAMESPACE } where: - {NAMESPACE} is the development namespace where the pipelines will run Run the following command to provision the Jenkins instance in your namespace oc new-app jenkins-ephemeral Open the OpenShift console as described in the login steps above Select Workloads -> Pods from the left-hand menu At the top of the page select your project/namespace from the drop-down list to see the Jenkins instance running Give the jenkins service account privileged access \u00b6 All of the Cloud-Native Toolkit pipelines use buildah to build and push the container image to the registry. Unfortunately, the buildah container must run as root. By default, OpenShift does not allow containers to run as the root user and special permission is required for the pipeline to run. With the Jenkins build engine, all the build processes run as the jenkins service account. In order for the pipeline container to run as root on OpenShift we will need to give the privileged security context constraint (scc) to jenkins service account with the following command: oc project { NAMESPACE } oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged -z jenkins where: - {NAMESPACE} should be the name you claimed in the box note prefixed to -dev (e.g. user01-dev) Create a secret with git credentials \u00b6 In order for Jenkins to have access to the git repository, particularly if it is a private repository, a Kubernetes secret needs to be added that contains the git credentials. Create a personal access token (if you don't already have one) using the prereq instructions Copy the following into a file called gitsecret.yaml and update the {Git-Username}, and {Git-PAT} apiVersion : v1 kind : Secret metadata : annotations : build.openshift.io/source-secret-match-uri-1 : https://github.com/* labels : jenkins.io/credentials-type : usernamePassword name : git-credentials type : kubernetes.io/basic-auth stringData : username : { Git-Username } password : { Git-PAT } where: - Git-Username is the username that has access to the git repo - Git-PAT is the personal access token of the git user After logging into the cluster, create the secret by running the following: oc project { NAMESPACE } oc create -f gitsecret.yaml where: - {NAMESPACE} is the development namespace where the pipelines will run Create the build config \u00b6 On OpenShift 4.3, Jenkins is built into the OpenShift console and the build pipelines can be managed using Kubernetes custom resources. The following steps will create one by hand to create the build pipeline for the new application. Copy the following into a file called buildconfig.yaml and update the {Name}, {Secret}, {Git-Repo-URL}, and {Namespace} apiVersion : v1 kind : BuildConfig metadata : name : { Name } spec : triggers : - type : GitHub github : secret : my-secret-value source : git : uri : { Git-Repo-URL } ref : master strategy : jenkinsPipelineStrategy : jenkinsfilePath : Jenkinsfile env : - name : CLOUD_NAME value : openshift - name : NAMESPACE value : { NAMESPACE } where: - Name is in the name of your pipeline - Git-Repo-URL is the https url to the git repository - {NAMESPACE} is the development namespace where the pipelines will run Assuming you are still logged into the cluster, create the buildconfig resource in the cluster oc project { NAMESPACE } oc create -f buildconfig.yaml where: - {NAMESPACE} is the development namespace where the pipelines will run View the pipeline in the OpenShift console \u00b6 Open the OpenShift console for the cluster Select Builds -> Build Config Select your project/namespace (i.e. {NAMESPACE} ) from the top The build pipeline that was created in the previous step should appear Manually trigger the pipeline by selecting Start Build the menu button on the right side of the row Create the webhook \u00b6 Run the following to get the webhook details from the build config oc project { NAMESPACE } oc describe bc { Name } where: - {Name} is the name used in the previous step for the build config - {NAMESPACE} is the development namespace where the pipelines will run The webhook url will have a structure similar to: http://{openshift_api_host:port}/oapi/v1/namespaces/{namespace}/buildconfigs/{name}/webhooks/{secret}/generic In this case {secret} will be my-secret-value Open a browser to the GitHub repo deployed in the previous step in the build config Select Settings then Webhooks . Press Add webhook Paste the webhook url from the previous step into the Payload url Set the content-type to application/json and leave the rest of the values as the defaults Press Add webhook to create the webhook Press the button to test the webhook to ensure that everything was done properly Go back to your project code and push a change to one of the files Go to the Build pipeline page in the OpenShift console to see that the build was triggered Manual steps for Jenkins on Kubernetes TBD enable \u00b6 Adds DevOps artifacts to a Git repo that the environment uses to deploy the app. The command displays a list of available pipelines and applies the one you select to your code repo. The DevOps files added to your repo include (but are not limited to): Helm chart Jenkinsfile This command DOES NOT require that the terminal is already logged in to an IBM Cloud account nor the cluster. It DOES require that the terminal's current directory is the repository directory for your local copy of the Git repo. The command will add files to the local repo. You should commit these new files and push them to the server repo. Then run igc pipeline to connect your repo to a pipeline in the environment.

These have been designed to support build to manage and give a production ready entry point for cloud-native development. While the use of the Starter Kits is not required to be able to use the development tools, their use is highly recommended to get up and running quickly. There are a small number of Starter Kit git repositories that provide support for different architecture layers of your cloud native solution these includes: User Interfaces Backend for Frontends Microservices Edge Apps You can pick the Starter Kit that best meets your requirements and it will seamlessly integrate with the installed development tools. You can work with more Starter Kits from developer.ibm.com . These patterns can be \"enabled\" using the Bring your own code approach on Starter Kits Docs . Even though they are \"enabled\" they are not optimized for production usage and do not include a number of key IBM Garage best practices. They are fully open source and they can be enhanced overtime. You can also work with the Starter Kits provided from the IBM Cloud IBM Cloud Starter Kits for the server side patterns you can \"enable\" these using the enable command on Cloud-Native Command Line Interface There is more information below on what is included in the Starter Kits . Why another Starter Kit \u00b6 As teams have built out production solutions using IBM Kubernetes Services and Red Hat OpenShift on the IBM Cloud it has became clear that starting with a hello-world style code slows down an agile team. In cases where you are learning the basic principles of cloud-native development with a specific language it does help to start with the basic principles of hello-world but when you are building production code to be used by real users it takes a lot of effort to industrialize this code ready for production. The objective of these Starter Kits is to kick off a project quickly so they can reach maximum development velocity in the least amount of time. To not contain any business logic and to have a set of proven opinionated frameworks that are commonly used in the industry this can include Express , React and testing frameworks. Why Starter Kits ? As the approach to cloud native microservice development has evolved a number of language frameworks have come into play, runtime configuration technologies and best practices to improve quality and robustness. It becomes very time consuming to create, manage and maintain these elements. If we look at a typical cloud-native app, they require a number of supporting files, similar to the ones found in the outer ring of this diagram. They take time to create and are only often needed for the initial seed of the project. Its also never clear where the documentation is for these elements and how they are work together. Some typical examples : Dockerfile Helm chart CI pipeline ( Jenkins , Tekton , etc.) TDD Frameworks Tracing Code Analysis Monitoring / Logging Support Cloud Service bindings and credentials User Case logic UI, BFF, Microservice The Starter Kits provide a key number of these supporting files and meta data and are tested on every code change to make sure they work with IBM Kubernetes and IBM Red Hat OpenShift managed clusters environments. Starter Kit Template \u00b6 The purpose of the Starter Kit is to provide the scaffold code for the elements outside of your working use case business logic. This will then allow a developer to get started a lot quicker and allow you to push code regularly into your CI environment. This code is optimized for build to manage scenarios where where logging, health are fully integrated. What constitutes a good Starter Kit \u00b6 If you want to contribute a Starter Kit have a look at the examples that are provided. They all have most of the features listed below. They must be UBI ( Universal Base Image ) based so they can run in Red Hat OpenShift as well as Kubernetes. They must have a Dockerfile that uses that UBI. To make them work with continuous integration, you can provide a Jenkins or Tekton pipeline. In some cases for Edge they base images may be different as they are optimized for size. Make sure there is a good use case that is repeatable in your solution architecture. Make sure the code is documented and includes a `README.md'. There is good code coverage for tests and you have integrated SonarQube code scanning on the build process. Finally them put in open source so other developers can enhance, improve or consume.

The deployment environment is a namespace in a container platform like Kubernetes or Red Hat OpenShift. Argo CD models a collection of applications as a project and uses a Git repository to store the application's desired state. Argo CD is flexible in the structure of the application configuration represented in the Git repository. Argo CD supports defining Kubernetes manifests in a number of ways: helm charts kustomize ksonnet jsonnet plain directory of yaml/json manifests custom plugins Argo CD compares the actual state of the application in the cluster with the desired state defined in Git and determines if they are out of sync. When it detects the environment is out of sync, Argo CD can be configured to either send out a notification to kick off a separate reconciliation process or Argo CD can automatically synchronize the environments to ensure they match. Note Confidential information like passwords and security tokens should not be checked into the Git repository. Managing secrets in Argo CD provides information on how to handle confidential information in the GitOps repo. Configuring GitOps with Argo CD \u00b6 Terminology: Argo CD uses a number of terms to refer to the components Application - A deployable unit In the context of the environment, an application is one Helm chart that contains one container image that was produced by one CI pipeline. While Helm charts and images could certainly be combined to make more sophisticated applications in more advanced scenarios, we will be using this simple definition here. Project - A collection of applications that make up a solution Set up the GitOps repo \u00b6 Argo CD uses a Git repo to express the desired state of the Kubernetes environment. The basic setup uses one repository to represent one project . Within that repository, each application that makes up the project will be described in its own folder. The repository will also contain a branch for each destination (i.e. cluster and namespace) into which we want to deploy the applications. Note There is nothing special about a git repository used for git-ops. All that is required at a minimum is a hosted git repository that is accessible from by the Argo CD instance. The Argo CD template used in the following steps is optional and provides some application templates to help simplify some configuration activities. Create a new repo from the Argo CD template . Click Use this template - If you see a 404 error when you click on the link, you need to sign in to github. Clone the project to your machine git clone ${ GIT_URL_GITOPS } navigate into the directory cd ${ GIT_DIRECTORY } Create and push test branch git checkout -b test git push -u origin test Hook the CI pipeline to the CD pipeline \u00b6 The last stage in the CI pipeline updates a GitOps repository with the updated application metadata from the build. In order to do that, the CI pipeline needs to know which repository should be used and needs the credentials to push changes to that repository. As with other configuration within the pipeline, this is handled with config maps and secrets: A secret named git-credentials holds the credentials the CI pipeline uses to access all the repositories in the Git host (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, etc). If you used the IGC CLI to register the pipeline then this secret has already been created. A config map named gitops-repo holds the url and branch for the gitops repository. Fortunately the IGC CLI provides a gitops command to simplify this step. Information on how to use the command as well as the alternative manual steps can be found in the IGC CLI gitops command section. Make sure to switch context to the project/namespace CI namespace oc project ${ DEV_NAMESPACE } Run the gitops command to create the config map and secret in the CI namespace igc gitops Note For the secret to be available to the CI pipeline, the secret needs to be created in the same namespace where the pipeline is running. The value provided for branch is the one the pipeline will use to when committing changes to trigger the CD pipeline. As of v2.0.0 of the Tekton tasks and the Jenkins pipelines, the CI pipeline will create a folder and the initial configuration for an application deployment if it doesn't already exist. This means, there is no other manual configuration required to set up the repository. Now run a new Pipeline and make sure a directory for the application is created on the gitops git repository. This is required before configuring ArgoCD. Configure Release namespaces \u00b6 ArgoCD will deploy the application into the \"releases\" namespace such as ${TEST_NAMESPACE} or ${STAGING_NAMESPACE} Create a release namespace where ArgoCD will deploy the application oc new-project ${ TEST_NAMESPACE } The release namespaces need pull secrets for the application container images to be pull. OpenShift Image Registry If you are using the OpenShift Image Registry then you need to give permission to the services accounts in the \"release\" namespaces to be able to pull images from the \"development\" namespaces. Grant access to service accounts in the new test or staging namespace to pull the container image from the dev namespace oc policy add-role-to-group system:image-puller system:serviceaccounts: { TEST_NAMESPACE } -n { DEV_NAMESPACE } IBM Container Registry If you are using the IBM Container Registry then you need to copy the pull secret all-icr-io from the default namespace and then add this secret to the service account used by your application (ie default service account) Use the Toolkit CLI to copy the secret and setup the service account igc pull-secret ${ TEST_NAMESPACE } -t default -z default Other Container Registries If you are using an external image registry from a 3rd party provider like quay.io or dockerhub.io then you need to create the pull secret of type \"docker-registry\" and add it to the service account. Check the OpenShift Documentation Using pull secrets Register the GitOps repo in ArgoCD \u00b6 Now that the repository has been created, we need to tell ArgoCD where it is. Log into ArgoCD Click on the gear icon on the left menu to access the Settings options Select the Repositories option Click either the Connect Repo using HTTPS or Connect Repo using SSH button at the top and provide the information for the GitOps repo you just created. For HTTPS you can use the access token you used when you ran igc gitops Create a project in Argo CD \u00b6 In Argo CD terms, each deployable component is an application and applications are grouped into projects. Projects are not required for Argo CD to be able to deploy applications, but it helps to organize applications and provide some restrictions on what can be done for applications that make up a project.

The plugin takes yaml configuration as input, looks up the credentials in Key Protect, and generates a secret in the cluster from the results. Note If Argo CD was installed via the Toolkit then the plugin should already be installed and ready to use. If not, the instructions for installing the plugin can be found in the plugin documentation . Prepare the Key Protect instance \u00b6 As the name suggests, the Argo CD Key Protect plugin ) leverages the capabilities of the Key Protect service to manage the protected information. The details for setting up and managing the Key Protect instance can be found in Secret management with Key Protect . From those instructions you can find the information required for the subsequent steps. Create the secret configuration \u00b6 The input to the plugin is a directory that contains one or more yaml \"secret templates\". In this case the \"secret template\" provides the structure of the desired secret with placeholders for the values that will be pulled from the key management system. Create a directory to contain the secret configuration. The Argo CD template repository has a template in templates/secrets-plugin that can be copied as a starting point Update the values in the yaml file for the secret that will be created apiVersion : keymanagement.ibm/v1 kind : SecretTemplate metadata : name : mysecret annotations : key-manager : key-protect key-protect/instanceId : instance-id key-protect/region : us-east spec : labels : {} annotations : {} values : - name : url value : https://ibm.com - name : username b64value : dGVhbS1jYXA= - name : password keyId : 36397b07-d98d-4c0b-bd7a-d6c290163684 The metadata.annotations value is optional. key-manager - the only value supported currently is key-protect key-protect/instanceId - the instance id of the key protect instance. If not provided then the instance-id value from the key-protect-access secret will be used. key-protect/region - the region where the key protect instance has been provisioned. If not provided then the region value from the key-protect-access secret will be used. The metadata.name value given will be used as the name for the Secret that will be generated. The information in spec.labels and spec.annotations will be copied over as the labels and annotations in the Secret that is generated The spec.values section contains the information that should be provided in the data section of the generated Secret. There are three possible ways the values can be provided: value - the actual value can be provided directly as clear text. This would be appropriate for information that is not sensitive but is required in the secret b64value - a base64 encoded value can be provided to the secret. This can be used for large values that might present formatting issues or for information that is not sensitive but that might be obfuscated a bit (like a username) keyId - the id (not the name) of the Standard Key that has been stored in Key Protect. The value stored in Key Protect can be anything Commit the changes to the GitOps repository Add the secret application in Argo CD \u00b6 Once the configuration has been added to the GitOps repository, Argo CD needs to be configured to deploy the secrets. === \"Argo CD UI 1.

The artifacts are often individual application components that can later be assembled into a full product. An artifact repository manager is an integral part of a CI/CD solution, a companion to the pipeline. As the pipeline builds artifacts, they're stored in the repositories. When the pipeline later needs artifacts that have already been built, they're retrieved from the repositories. This enables a build to be broken into smaller stages with well-defined inputs and outputs and provides better tracking of each stage's results. Often a failed pipeline can restart in the middle using artifacts that were already built and stored. An artifact repository often serves as the storage for a package manager, which assembles an application from artifacts. Here are some common package managers and their repositories: Maven : Builds Java artifacts (such as Jar, War, Ear, etc.) and projects stored in Maven repositories such as Maven Central npm : Assembles programs from JavaScript packages stored in npm-registries such as the public npm registry PIP : Installs Python packages from index repositories such as the Python Package Index (PyPI) Helm : Deploys applications to Kubernetes using charts stored in Helm repositories such as the Helm Hub catalog of repositories Docker is not a package manager, but its architecture includes an artifact repository: Docker : Stores images in Docker registries such as Docker Hub Note that you do not need a very large team to start reaping benefits from an artifact repository manager.

Container Image Security Enforcement verifies container images before deploying them to a cluster. You can control where images are deployed from, enforce Vulnerability Advisor policies, and ensure that content trust is properly applied to the image. If an image does not meet your policy requirements, the pod is not deployed to your cluster or updated. Container Image security is applied on a per-cluster basis. This can be enabled in for a cluster in IBM Cloud in a single command using the IBM Cloud CLI . ibmcloud oc cluster image-security enable -c <cluster name> This command will configure the cluster to use Container Image Security, which installs Portieris in the cluster, and will also create ClusterImagePolicy instances to enforce signatures for IBM Cloud images. Portieris is a Kubernetes admission controller for the enforcement of image security policies. With Portieris you can create image security policies either for each Kubernetes namespace or at the cluster level, and enforce different rules for different images. Portieris will block deployment for any image that fails signature validation as defined by the image policies. Thus ensuring that the images running inside of your cluster are unmodified from their original source. Note Portieris can be used in clusters that are not running on IBM Cloud by installing via the helm chart . Enabling Policy Enforcement \u00b6 Portieris uses RedHat Signatures to sign container images. To take advantage of Portieris and policy enforcement, you need 3 things: 1. A GnuPG key to sign container images, stored in a vault 2. A process to sign container images using the key from the credentials vault 3. An ImagePolicy or ClusterImagePolicy that can instruct Portieris to apply enforcement rules The following steps are based on signing images for trusted content . Getting started quickly \u00b6 A script that demonstrates how to easily create a GPG key, publish it to a vault, setup cluster secrets, and setup a default ClusterImagePolicy (as described below) is available at https://github.com/IBM/ibm-garage-tekton-tasks/blob/image-signing/utilities/setup-image-signing-keys.sh The toolkit's 2-build-tag-push.yaml tekton task has also been updated to accept the output of this script and enforce signatures during the builder's push phase. Create an Image Signing Key \u00b6 An image signing key must be created to sign the container images. This can be done by executing the following command: gpg --generate-key This will create a public and private key combination that can be used to sign and verify container images. The output of the gpg --generate-key command will show the fingerprint of the newly generated key. This fingerprint will be needed in the following steps. Saving the private key in a vault \u00b6 Once your key has been generated, the private key should be stored within a credentials vault, such as Key Protect or IBM HyperProtect Crypto Services . The private key should be placed in the vault as a base64 encoded string, which can be accessed by your Tekton pipeline during the image building task. To place the private key in a vault ENCODED_PRIVATE_KEY = $( gpg --export-secret-key <KEY_FINGERPRINT> | base64 ) curl -X POST https://<region>.kms.cloud.ibm.com/api/v2/keys \\ -H 'authorization: Bearer <IAM_token>' \\ -H 'bluemix-instance: <instance_ID>' \\ -H 'content-type: application/vnd.ibm.kms.key+json' \\ -d \"{ \\\"metadata\\\": { \\\"collectionType\\\": \\\"application/vnd.ibm.kms.key+json\\\", \\\"collectionTotal\\\": 1 }, \\\"resources\\\": [ { \\\"type\\\": \\\"application/vnd.ibm.kms.key+json\\\", \\\"name\\\": \\\"image-signing-key\\\", \\\"aliases\\\": [], \\\"description\\\": \\\"Private key for signing container images\\\", \\\"payload\\\": \\\" $ENCODED_PRIVATE_KEY \\\", \\\"extractable\\\": true } ] }\" Both Key Protect and Hyper Protect Crypto Services have an identical API, so the previous steps are identical except that a different API endpoint is used. Saving the public key \u00b6 The public key needs to be made available to the cluster for verifying container image signatures by either creating a secret within the cluster, or making the public key available through Artifactory . Use the following commands to make the public key available for policy enforcement by creating a secret within the cluster: gpg --export --armour <KEY_FINGERPRINT> > key.pubkey oc create secret generic image-signing-public-key --from-file = key = key.pubkey Signing container images \u00b6 Container image policy enforcement will reject images that are not signed, so you need to sign images either when they are pushed to the container registry. This can be done using either the skopeo copy command or buildah push command, depending when you want to sign your images. Extracting the private key for signing \u00b6 The following commands can be used to access your private key from the vault, and import it into gpg for use in signing. This would be used inside of your pipeline: echo \"Getting private key from keystore for image signing\" curl -s -o payload \\ https://<region>.kms.cloud.ibm.com/api/v2/keys/<key_ID_or_alias> \\ -H \"Authorization: Bearer <IAM_token>\" \\ -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\ -H \"bluemix-instance: <instance_ID>\" ENCODEDKEY = $( jq \".resources[0].payload\" -r payload ) echo $ENCODEDKEY > encodedkey base64 -d encodedkey > decodedkey echo \"Importing key\" gpg --import decodedkey Once the key is imported, then the image can be signed. If the image is being signed at build time, the signature can be specified by the --sign-by parameter to the buildah command: buildah --sign-by <KEY_FINGERPRINT> --storage-driver = overlay push --digestfile ./image-digest ${ APP_IMAGE } docker:// ${ APP_IMAGE } If the image is being signed at copy-time, it can be specified as a parameter to the skopeo command: skopeo --sign-by <KEY_FINGERPRINT> copy ${ IMAGE_FROM_CREDS } docker:// ${ IMAGE_FROM } docker:// ${ IMAGE_TO } Create image policies \u00b6 Finally, image policies need to be created to instruct Portieris which keys should be used to sign images from specific container registries. These policies can be applied globally to the entire cluster using a ClusterImagePolicy , or to a specific namespace using an ImagePolicy . In those policies, rules can be defined for enforcement for specific container registries/namespaces, or globally to all container registries used by the cluster. For example, the following ClusterImagePolicy enforces a policy that all images in the container registry icr.io/mynamespace/* must be signed by the public key that was earlier created and placed into the image-signing-public-key cluster secret. apiVersion : portieris.cloud.ibm.com/v1 kind : ClusterImagePolicy metadata : name : mynamespace-cluster-image-policy spec : repositories : - name : \"icr.io/mynamespace/*\" policy : simple : requirements : - type : \"signedBy\" keySecret : image-signing-public-key More information about policies and enforcement can be found in the Portieris Policies documentation Tekton tasks \u00b6 A script that demonstrates how to easily create a GPG key, publish it to a vault, setup cluster secrets, and setup a default ClusterImagePolicy is available at IBM/ibm-garage-tekton-tasks/setup-image-signing-keys.sh The toolkit's 2-build-tag-push.yaml tekton task has also been updated to accept the output of this script and enforce signatures during the builder's push phase.

When hosted in IBM Cloud, the environment uses the IBM Cloud Container Registry for storing container images. What is the IBM Cloud Container Registry \u00b6 IBM Cloud Container Registry is a private, multi-tenant Docker registry built into IBM Cloud for storing OCI images . Each IBM Cloud region hosts its own highly available registry. When deploying an application to a Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster, the cluster creates containers using the images in the registry. To package an application for deployment, the runtime must be built into an image that is stored in the registry. In this standard Docker diagram, the acme.com domain is effectively an IBM Cloud region and the Docker private registry is the instance of IBM Cloud Container Registry in that region. The diagram shows these components and their relationships: Developer builds the image; ideally it is automated as part of a CI pipeline Docker private registry stores the image that was built UAT , Promote , and Production are deployment environments, such as Kubernetes clusters or namespaces, that run the containers based on the image Accessing the registry \u00b6 There are two ways to work with an IBM Cloud registry : Web UI : In the IBM Cloud console, navigate to either Kubernetes or OpenShift and then Registry CLI : Use the container-registry CLI plug-in in the IBM Cloud CLI Of the two approaches, the CLI is much more powerful. The console is mainly for looking at your registry. When you installed the prerequisites , part of installing the IBM Cloud CLI installed several other tools and plug-ins including the container-registry plug-in. To use the container-registry plug-in, or even to push an image into the registry using a local Docker install, you must first log into IBM Cloud and then log into the region's IBM Cloud Container Registry: ibmcloud login ibmcloud cr login The logins determine the namespaces you can access . Other accounts for other tenants also have namespaces in the registry, but IBM Cloud doesn't let you see them and prevents you from accessing their images. Registry organization \u00b6 Like the directories and file names in a file system, a Docker registry is a single collection of images that is cataloged with hierarchical names. A Docker registry such as Docker Hub (or, as we'll see, a registry in IBM Cloud) stores an image with a hierarchical name: namespace, repository, and tag. This path is specified when tagging and pushing the image: docker tag <image> <namesapce>/<repo-name>:<tag> docker push <namesapce>/<repo-name>:<tag> To tag and push an image to any registry other than Docker Hub, you have to specify its domain as part of the path: docker push <domain>/<namesapce>/<repo-name>:<tag> Registry organization in an IBM Cloud account \u00b6 IBM's registry organizes images in this same hierarchical structure. Domain : Each region in IBM Cloud (e.g. Dallas, London, Sydney, etc.) has its own multi-tenant registry instance with its own domain name (such as us.icr.io for Dallas/us-south). IBM provides its public images in a global registry (domain icr.io (no region)). Namespace : A namespace is associated with an IBM Cloud account and groups the account's images. Every user in the account can view and work with all images in the namespace, but users outside of the account cannot access images in the account's namespaces. An account may use multiple namespaces to organize images for groupings such as development vs. production or approved vs. experimental. Each namespace must have a name that is unique within a region for all accounts (not just your account). Repository : A repo is often thought of as the name of the image, but technically the same image can have different names (but the same image ID). Within a registry, different images with the same name stored in the same namespace will be stored in the same repo as long as they have different tags. Tag : Optional; if a command does not specify it, the default tag is latest . Two different tags enable a namespace to store two images with different image IDs but the same repository name. The tag typically specifies a different build of an image with a different image ID. Two builds usually package two different versions of an application's code, but Docker does not enforce that. The two builds could just be the same Dockerfile run twice with the same inputs (and therefore equivalent), or two completely unrelated sets of software. But two builds usually run software that is similar but at least slightly different, such as a new version of an application's code, but could be simply an alternative implementation of the code (such as for A/B testing). Therefore, when adding an image to a registry in IBM Cloud , the push command specifies the image's hierarchical path like this: docker push <region>.icr.io/<my_namespace>/<image_repo>:<tag> You can see this structure when you show the registry using the CLI: ibmcloud cr image-list Listing images...

And Namespace is specified again in its own column, which is useful for filtering searches. You can also see that the first two items in the list are not two separate images but really the same image with two tags: the image ID (a.k.a. digest) is the same, so the two tags are two different ways to look up the same image. Likewise, the last two images are really the same image with two tags. The registry in the IBM Cloud console shows the same images: It shows more clearly that each image has two tags, rather than being two different images. IBM Cloud Container Registry features \u00b6 IBM Cloud Container Registry is not only a Docker registry hosted in IBM Cloud, it adds several features to the registry service. The registry in each region is private, multi-tenant, and highly available--properties that a simple registry doesn't have. Here are some other features and capabilities. Vulnerability Advisor scans images in the registry to search for known security issues and generates reports with advice on how to fix your images and better secure your environment. Lists of the vulnerabilities scanned for are available in Vulnerable packages . An administrator can specify exemptions that should not be reported. Running containers are not scanned , just the images in the registry. In the image lists shown above, the Security status column shows the number of issues found; the report will explain them in greater detail. In the console, click on the number of issues for details. Trusted content technology : IBM Cloud Container Registry supports images signed using RedHat Signatures . The signature confirms who built the image, such as the CI tool. The push and pull commands maintain image signatures. Container Image Security Enforcement verifies container images before deploying them to a cluster. You can control where images are deployed from, enforce Vulnerability Advisor policies, and ensure that content trust is properly applied to the image. If an image does not meet your policy requirements, the pod is not deployed to your cluster or updated. User authorization : While all users in an account have access to that account's namespaces in the registry, an account manager can use IAM to manage the access for different users. For example, a common customer concern is: \"How can an administrator control which images can be downloaded from Docker Hub and deployed into production?\" By using IAM to control access to the registry, a manager can disable the ability to push, build, or delete images, then create a policy to allow these actions and only assign it to certain trusted users such as the CI pipeline's service ID. These privileged users should only add approved images into the registry, thereby limiting the containers that the developers can deploy. The managers can likewise limit what the CD pipeline can possibly deploy to production by creating a namespace that only includes images approved for production and restricting the CD pipeline to deploy from that namespace. Image registry in the Pipeline \u00b6 The CI and CD pipelines currently exchange two types of artifacts: Docker images and Helm charts. The CI pipeline ( Jenkins , Tekton , etc.) builds these artifacts and ArgoCD deploys them. To store and share the artifacts, the pipeline uses two repositories: Docker images : This Developer Tools Image Registry Helm charts : A Helm repository in Artifactory In the CI pipeline, the Build image stage creates the Docker image and stores it in the registry. Then the Deploy to DEV env stage specifies the image's path in the Helm chart's values file, which the chart will use to deploy the app. Likewise, the CD pipeline specifies the image's registry path in the values files for the other deployments. When the Helm chart runs, it and Kubernetes read the image from the registry and start the containers. Give it a try \u00b6 Let's take a look at using the registry. If you haven't already, deploy your first app For example, deploy the template named Typescript Microservice I deployed my in a project named dev-guide-example-bw In the IBM Cloud console, navigate to either Kubernetes or OpenShift and then Registry It doesn't matter whether you navigate via the Kubernetes panel or the OpenShift panel, the share the same registry The registry is the IBM Cloud Container Registry for your region In the registry, search for the image named for your project In the CLI, run the corresponding command ibmcloud cr image-list | grep dev-guide-example-bw us.icr.io/mooc-team-one/dev-guide-example-bw 1.0.0 a2138c3025ac mooc-team-one 4 hours ago 286 MB 5 Issues us.icr.io/mooc-team-one/dev-guide-example-bw 1.0.0-1 a2138c3025ac mooc-team-one 4 hours ago 286 MB 5 Issues Back in the console, click on the image to see its details Under Security Status , click on 5 issues to see the issues that Vulnerability Advisor found in this image What it found was configuration issues Scroll down to see the list of configuration issues Conclusion \u00b6 We've seen that the CI pipeline packages an app as a Docker image and stores it in the registry, and also builds a Helm chart that references the image in the registry so that the chart can deploy containers built from the image. In IBM Cloud, the registry is the IBM Cloud Container Registry. The registry displays all of the namespaces in your account but not those in other tenants' accounts. In addition to basic registry functions, IBM Cloud adds additional features: private, multi-tenant, highly available, Vulnerability Advisor, Trusted content technology, Container Image Security Enforcement, and User authorization. Using the registry, you can see your list of images, details about the image, and details about any issues that Vulnerability Advisor found.","title":"IBM Container Registry"},{"location":"reference/tools/ibm-cloud-container-registry/#ibm-cloud-container-registry","text":"The CI/CD pipeline stores container images in an image registry In IBM Garage Method, one of the Develop practices is to automate continuous delivery through a delivery pipeline , in part by using an artifact repository for storing output of the build stage.

To use the container-registry plug-in, or even to push an image into the registry using a local Docker install, you must first log into IBM Cloud and then log into the region's IBM Cloud Container Registry: ibmcloud login ibmcloud cr login The logins determine the namespaces you can access . Other accounts for other tenants also have namespaces in the registry, but IBM Cloud doesn't let you see them and prevents you from accessing their images.","title":"Accessing the registry"},{"location":"reference/tools/ibm-cloud-container-registry/#registry-organization","text":"Like the directories and file names in a file system, a Docker registry is a single collection of images that is cataloged with hierarchical names. A Docker registry such as Docker Hub (or, as we'll see, a registry in IBM Cloud) stores an image with a hierarchical name: namespace, repository, and tag. This path is specified when tagging and pushing the image: docker tag <image> <namesapce>/<repo-name>:<tag> docker push <namesapce>/<repo-name>:<tag> To tag and push an image to any registry other than Docker Hub, you have to specify its domain as part of the path: docker push <domain>/<namesapce>/<repo-name>:<tag>","title":"Registry organization"},{"location":"reference/tools/ibm-cloud-container-registry/#registry-organization-in-an-ibm-cloud-account","text":"IBM's registry organizes images in this same hierarchical structure. Domain : Each region in IBM Cloud (e.g. Dallas, London, Sydney, etc.) has its own multi-tenant registry instance with its own domain name (such as us.icr.io for Dallas/us-south). IBM provides its public images in a global registry (domain icr.io (no region)). Namespace : A namespace is associated with an IBM Cloud account and groups the account's images. Every user in the account can view and work with all images in the namespace, but users outside of the account cannot access images in the account's namespaces. An account may use multiple namespaces to organize images for groupings such as development vs. production or approved vs. experimental. Each namespace must have a name that is unique within a region for all accounts (not just your account). Repository : A repo is often thought of as the name of the image, but technically the same image can have different names (but the same image ID). Within a registry, different images with the same name stored in the same namespace will be stored in the same repo as long as they have different tags. Tag : Optional; if a command does not specify it, the default tag is latest . Two different tags enable a namespace to store two images with different image IDs but the same repository name. The tag typically specifies a different build of an image with a different image ID. Two builds usually package two different versions of an application's code, but Docker does not enforce that. The two builds could just be the same Dockerfile run twice with the same inputs (and therefore equivalent), or two completely unrelated sets of software. But two builds usually run software that is similar but at least slightly different, such as a new version of an application's code, but could be simply an alternative implementation of the code (such as for A/B testing). Therefore, when adding an image to a registry in IBM Cloud , the push command specifies the image's hierarchical path like this: docker push <region>.icr.io/<my_namespace>/<image_repo>:<tag> You can see this structure when you show the registry using the CLI: ibmcloud cr image-list Listing images...

You can also see that the first two items in the list are not two separate images but really the same image with two tags: the image ID (a.k.a. digest) is the same, so the two tags are two different ways to look up the same image. Likewise, the last two images are really the same image with two tags.

Vulnerability Advisor scans images in the registry to search for known security issues and generates reports with advice on how to fix your images and better secure your environment. Lists of the vulnerabilities scanned for are available in Vulnerable packages . An administrator can specify exemptions that should not be reported. Running containers are not scanned , just the images in the registry. In the image lists shown above, the Security status column shows the number of issues found; the report will explain them in greater detail. In the console, click on the number of issues for details. Trusted content technology : IBM Cloud Container Registry supports images signed using RedHat Signatures . The signature confirms who built the image, such as the CI tool. The push and pull commands maintain image signatures. Container Image Security Enforcement verifies container images before deploying them to a cluster. You can control where images are deployed from, enforce Vulnerability Advisor policies, and ensure that content trust is properly applied to the image. If an image does not meet your policy requirements, the pod is not deployed to your cluster or updated. User authorization : While all users in an account have access to that account's namespaces in the registry, an account manager can use IAM to manage the access for different users. For example, a common customer concern is: \"How can an administrator control which images can be downloaded from Docker Hub and deployed into production?\" By using IAM to control access to the registry, a manager can disable the ability to push, build, or delete images, then create a policy to allow these actions and only assign it to certain trusted users such as the CI pipeline's service ID. These privileged users should only add approved images into the registry, thereby limiting the containers that the developers can deploy. The managers can likewise limit what the CD pipeline can possibly deploy to production by creating a namespace that only includes images approved for production and restricting the CD pipeline to deploy from that namespace.","title":"IBM Cloud Container Registry features"},{"location":"reference/tools/ibm-cloud-container-registry/#image-registry-in-the-pipeline","text":"The CI and CD pipelines currently exchange two types of artifacts: Docker images and Helm charts.

Pact automates contract testing and enables it to be added to a continuous integration pipeline. The environment's CI pipeline ( Jenkins , Tekton , etc.) includes a Pact stage. Simply by building your app using the CI pipeline, your code's contract gets tested, just open the Pact UI to browse the results. What is contract testing \u00b6 Contract testing is a testing discipline that ensures two applications (a consumer and a provider) have a shared understanding of the interactions or the contract between them. The Pact framework has been selected for the provided tool set. Pact is a consumer-driven contract testing framework. More details can be found here - Pact overview . The framework has been built into the templates and a Pact Broker instance is provisioned in the cluster along with the other tools. In consumer-driven contract testing it is the consumer who defines the contract in terms of the expected interactions, the data structure, and the expected responses. That contract can then be used on the consumer-side to mock the interactions and validate the consumer behavior. More importantly, the contract can be shared with the provider of the interaction so that the provider's responses can be validated to ensure the consumer's expectations are met. In the Pact framework, the contract is called a pact . A pact consists of one or more interactions . Each interaction has the following structure: Given a *state* of {state} *upon receiving* a {description} request *with request* parameters - HTTP method - path - headers - body *will respond with* values like - status - headers - body where: {state} is an optional string that describes the initial state. This value can be used by the provider during testing to make sure the preconditions are met {description} is a unique description of the interaction the request parameters can contain any values that describe the interaction the response contains the relevant information for the consumer. The response values can be exact values or using matchers for type, regular expressions, etc Consumer \u00b6 Using the Pact framework libraries in conjunction with the unit testing framework on the consumer, the pact for the interaction between the consumer and provider is generated and validated. As part of the pact test setup, a Pact server is started and configured with the expected interactions. All of the consumer service invocations are directed at the Pact server which provides mock responses based on the interactions defined by the pact . At the end of the test, if all the interactions completed successfully a file containing the pact definition is generated. The following diagram gives an overview of the consumer interactions: An example pact test on a Typescript consumer using the jest testing framework is provided below. It has been broken into several parts. Pact server config \u00b6 At the beginning of the test file, the pact server is configured and started in the beforeAll() block. The afterAll() block finalizes the pacts by writing them out to a file and stopping the pact server. const port = 1234 ; const baseUrl = `http://localhost: ${ port } ` ; let pact : Pact ; beforeAll (() => { pact = new Pact ({ consumer : consumerName , provider : providerName , logLevel : 'error' , port , }); return pact . setup (); }); afterAll (() => { return pact . finalize () . catch ( err => console . error ( 'Error finalizing pact' , err )); }); Setup the service \u00b6 Next, an instance of the component that will be tested is loaded and configured with the pact server host and port as the base url used for the interactions. In this example, the consumer is using the typescript-ioc library to inject the baseUrl config value into the service. let service : SampleApi ; beforeAll (() => { Container . bind ( MyServiceConfig ) . provider ({ get : () => ({ baseUrl })}); service = Container . get ( SampleService ); }); Define and test the interaction \u00b6 For each interaction with the provider, a test similar to the one provided below is created. In it, the Pact framework is used to define the interaction. The addInteraction() publishes the interaction to the Pact server so that it can be used to provide a mock response when the request is made. The mock response is then used to validate the behavior of the component that is being tested. The example below is simple and passes the provider response directly through the service api but in more sophisticated examples the value would be transformed. describe ( 'given createWidget()' , () => { context ( 'when called with valid request' , () => { const widgetRequest = {...}; const widgetResponse = {...}; beforeEach (() => { return pact . addInteraction ({ uponReceiving : 'a valid widget request' , withRequest : { method : 'POST' , path : '/widgets' , headers : { 'Content-Type' : 'application/json' , 'Accept' : 'application/json' , }, body : widgetRequest , }, willRespondWith : { status : 200 , headers : { 'Content-Type' : Matchers . regex ({ generate : 'application/json' , matcher : 'application/json.*' }), }, body : Matchers.like ( widgetResponse ), }, }); }); test ( 'then return 200 status' , async () => { expect ( await service . createWidget ( widgetRequest )). toEqual ( widgetResponse ); }); }); }); Provider \u00b6 The provider uses the Pact framework to verify the running server against the pact , either one started locally as part of the test or another instance running elsewhere. The interactions in the pact are sent to the provider by a mock consumer in the Pact framework and the results are verified against the expected results defined by the pact. As an optional configuration for the verification process, an endpoint can be provided that handles the state information in the pact in order to ensure the preconditions for the test are met. (E.g. state=\"given an empty database\"). In order for these tests to be repeatable, it is often advisable to stand up a clean backend to run the pact tests when the tests start and tear it down when the tests are completed. For example, if a provider interacts with a Cloudant database point the test provider at a new database instance for the tests. The following diagram shows the interactions for the pact provider: Pact Broker \u00b6 One of the underpinning requirements of the pact verification process is the ability to make the pact files generated by the consumer available to the provider. When the pact verification is run in an automated pipeline this is difficult without an intermediary. Within the Pact framework, the Pact Broker provides the facility for consumers and providers to share the pact definitions with minimal dependencies between the systems. Additionally, the Pact Broker provides a place to define webhooks to trigger the provider build process when the pact definition changes and a way record and visualize the results of the verification process. The high-level interaction is shown below: templates \u00b6 The templates have been built with the frameworks necessary to generate and publish pacts for api consumers and verify against pacts and publish the results for api providers. The pipelines will do all the publishing and verification against Pact Broker if an instance of Pact Broker has been configured within the cluster.

The example below is simple and passes the provider response directly through the service api but in more sophisticated examples the value would be transformed. describe ( 'given createWidget()' , () => { context ( 'when called with valid request' , () => { const widgetRequest = {...}; const widgetResponse = {...}; beforeEach (() => { return pact . addInteraction ({ uponReceiving : 'a valid widget request' , withRequest : { method : 'POST' , path : '/widgets' , headers : { 'Content-Type' : 'application/json' , 'Accept' : 'application/json' , }, body : widgetRequest , }, willRespondWith : { status : 200 , headers : { 'Content-Type' : Matchers . regex ({ generate : 'application/json' , matcher : 'application/json.*' }), }, body : Matchers.like ( widgetResponse ), }, }); }); test ( 'then return 200 status' , async () => { expect ( await service . createWidget ( widgetRequest )). toEqual ( widgetResponse ); }); }); });","title":"Define and test the interaction"},{"location":"reference/tools/pact/#provider","text":"The provider uses the Pact framework to verify the running server against the pact , either one started locally as part of the test or another instance running elsewhere. The interactions in the pact are sent to the provider by a mock consumer in the Pact framework and the results are verified against the expected results defined by the pact. As an optional configuration for the verification process, an endpoint can be provided that handles the state information in the pact in order to ensure the preconditions for the test are met. (E.g. state=\"given an empty database\"). In order for these tests to be repeatable, it is often advisable to stand up a clean backend to run the pact tests when the tests start and tear it down when the tests are completed. For example, if a provider interacts with a Cloudant database point the test provider at a new database instance for the tests. The following diagram shows the interactions for the pact provider:","title":"Provider"},{"location":"reference/tools/pact/#pact-broker","text":"One of the underpinning requirements of the pact verification process is the ability to make the pact files generated by the consumer available to the provider.

Adding code analysis to ALM provides regular, timely feedback on the quality of the code being produced. The goal is to detect problems as soon as possible so that they can be resolved before they can impact production end users. The continuous integration (CI) server integrates SonarQube into the ALM.The SonarQube solution consists of several components: The central component is the SonarQube Server, which runs the SonarScanner, processes the resulting analysis reports, stores the reports in SonarQube Database, and displays the reports in the SonarQube UI. A CI server uses a stage/goal/task in its build automation to trigger the language-specific SonarScanner to scan the code being built. Developers can view the resulting analysis report in the SonarQube UI. Code Analysis in the Pipeline \u00b6 In the CI pipeline, the Sonar scan stage triggers the SonarScanner in SonarQube. Follow these directions to see code analysis in action: Deploy the template named Spring Boot Microservice.

In the Reliability pane of the project's Overview page, click on the \"2\" to open the Issues page The Issues page, filtered for bugs, shows two issues. Both concern \"synchronized\" methods. In the Issues list, click on either issue to see where the issues appeared in the code The Issues detail shows the source code file for the Java class. The issue descriptions are embedded after the mark and reset method signatures. In either issue, press the See Rule button. SonarQube displays the details of its \"Overrides should match their parent class methods in synchronization\" rule. Now you need to investigate to figure out why the code violates this rule. Want to see if you can track down the problem before seeing the solution? What to fix is pretty obvious--the Rule explains what to do--but tracking down why takes some effort. Here's the solution: The error is not in the file's parent class, ResettableHttpServletRequest , but in its embedded class, SimpleServletInputStream , which extends javax.servlet.ServletInputStream . The Javadocs for ServletInputStream show that it extends java.io.InputStream . The original Java 1.0 Javadocs show that these methods in InputStream are indeed synchronized: public synchronized void mark ( int readlimit ) . . . public synchronized void reset () throws IOException More recent Javadocs haven't shown these signatures for years, but the compiler says the class is still defined that way. There's some debate about whether mark and reset really need to be synchronized . But SonarQube doesn't judge, it just reports: Since the superclass defined the method signatures as synchronized, SonarQube is warning that the subclass is supposed to do so as well. Examine the other issues \u00b6 Besides the bugs, SonarQube also found issues that are host spots and code smells. In the SonarQube dashboard, go back to the Issues page Click on the \"1\" above Security hot spots The issue warns to \"Make sure that command line arguments are used safely here.\" SonarQube considers any class that has a public static void main(String[] args) method to be a potential vulnerability. As the rule explains, \"Command line arguments can be dangerous just like any other user input. They should never be used without being first validated and sanitized.\" This method passes them through unchecked, which is risky. Back in the Issues page, click on \"17\" code smells SonarQube found issues such as: - Remove this unused import 'java.lang.System.lineSeparator'. - Move constants to a class or enum. - This block of commented-out lines of code should be removed. None of these break your app's functionality, but they do make the code more difficult to maintain. Give it a try \u00b6 As we saw earlier, SonarQube found two bugs in our Java app. Let's do something about that. Add a quality gate to SonarQube \u00b6 The first problem is that the quality gate says that the app passed. The default quality gate is OK with those two bugs, but we're not. Let's create a new quality gate that checks for bugs. Use the Developer Dashboard to open the SonarQube dashboard To create and install a new quality gate, first log in to SonarQube Go to the Quality Gates page Make a copy of the default gate named Sonar way , give it a name like better gate {your initials} , i.e. better gate bw Add a condition, Bugs is greater than 0 Add your project to this gate Run the pipeline again to scan the code again. Back in the OpenShift console, on the Application Console > Builds > Pipelines page, press Start Pipeline After the Sonar Scan stage completes, go back to the SonarQube dashboard and take a look at your project Good news, the quality gate is working and SonarQube fails the project now! Add a stage to Jenkins \u00b6 Error Do not complete this step for the homework task, when working on the the shared development environment, the SonarQube Plugin is not correctly configured for this environment. However, take a look at your pipeline (in the OpenShift console). It kept right on going! We don't want the pipeline to keep going and deploy the app; if the code fails the quality gate, we want the pipeline to stop. Modify the Jenkins pipeline to add a Quality Gate stage. In the local Git repo that contains your source code (e.g. sonar-app-bw ), edit the file named Jenkinsfile After the stage called Sonar Scan, insert this stage: stage(\"Quality Gate\") { timeout(time: 1, unit: 'HOURS') { // Parameter indicates whether to set pipeline to UNSTABLE if Quality Gate fails // true = set pipeline to UNSTABLE, false = don't waitForQualityGate abortPipeline: true } Push the change to the server repo, which runs the pipeline again, and the Quality Gate stage fails Good. Now, when SonarQube finds bugs in our app, the quality gate fails and the Jenkins stage fails. Fix the code \u00b6 Now that our pipeline detects problems in our code, let's fix those problems. As discussed before, the bugs are that two methods need to be marked as synchronized. Let's fix the code. Edit the class com.ibm.cloud_garage.logging.inbound.ResettableHttpServletRequest Edit the methods mark and reset to make them both synchronized public synchronized void mark ( int i ) { . . . public synchronized void reset () throws IOException { Push the change to the server repo, which runs the pipeline again, and this time the Quality Gate stage passes Check the project in SonarQube and see that it now has 0 bugs and has now passed Extra credit : The code still has 17 code smells. Go fix those! Conclusion \u00b6 It's a good idea to incorporate code analysis as part of your application development lifecycle, so you can use its findings to help enforce and improve your code quality. Here, the environment uses SonarQube, but you never had to run SonarQube. Just run the environment's build pipeline on your app and it gets scanned automatically.

IAM can be complex; these best practices make IAM easier to use. Introduction \u00b6 This tutorial teaches you best practices for using Identity and Access Management (IAM) in IBM Cloud .

You can access the presentation in the Office Hours folder in Box. The scripts described in the reference section . Requirements for access control \u00b6 Access control doesn't change the features available in IBM Cloud. It does change who can use which features. One approach to access control is to not use it. Just give everyone access to everything and trust that each user will only do what they should. This is a bit like a hotel where the room doors don't have locks, but each guest is trusted to only enter their own room. Another approach is to limit which users can do what. Some users can enter almost every room (e.g. hotel management), some can rent rooms (e.g. the paying guest), and some can enter the rooms that have been rented for them (e.g. the paying guest's family). This article is about how to apply these limits in IBM Cloud. Here are two common scenarios for employing these limits: Account owner adds users to their account : An account owner must pay for all resources created in their account. How can they control which users can create resources in their account, and which can only use existing resources without creating new ones? Some resources can be expensive, so the owner will want to limit who can create them. Multiple teams developing apps : Each development team can have their own development environment. Each developer on a team should have access to their team's environment but not the other environments. They may be allowed to change aspects of their own environment (such as deploying apps), but should not be able to change other teams' environments. IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) \u00b6 Access to resources in IBM Cloud is controlled using IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM). Identity and access management (IAM) is a general approach many software systems use to authenticate clients and authorize them to use functionality. What is IBM Cloud Identity and Access Management? introduces IBM Cloud's implementation of IAM, which includes this diagram of the IAM components and their relationships: The most fundamental component type is a resource. To organize an account that will be shared by numerous users in various roles, two key aspects are: Create a good set of resource groups to organize the resources Create a good set of access groups to assign access to the resources The documentation explains some strategies: Best practices for setting up your account What is a resource? Best practices for organizing resources in a resource group Best practices for assigning access The IAM structure enables a lot of flexibility for very fine-grained access control. However, this broad range of capabilities can be complex to learn and is often more than many administrators need. This article will focus on the most important IAM components and best practices for how to use those. IAM \u2013- Main components \u00b6 This is a much simpler diagram of the main component types in IAM: In words, this diagram says, \"An access group uses policies to access the resources in a resource group.\" Here are the four main component types (three shown in the diagram) and their purposes: Resource : Anything running in IBM Cloud that can be created from the cloud catalog. Examples include: A Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster, a service instance, even a service itself. Resource Group : Resources that go together, typically to support an app. A common example is: A cluster and its service instances. Access Group : Users who perform the same tasks; the same concept as a role in role-based access control (RBAC). For example: Developers on a team developing an app. Policy : Permissions (bundled as Roles) for users to access resources. Example: Administrator and Manager of the Kubernetes Service (aka IKS). This perspective -- focusing on the main components instead of all of them -- is the beginning of explaining best practices for using IAM. This does not focus on everything IAM can do or on what users must do or can't do, but focuses on recommending what users should do to use IAM successfully. What is a resource group? \u00b6 Let's delve into what a resource group is. A resource group is a group of resources! (Duh!!) But does that mean it's a good idea to grab a bunch of arbitrary resources and put them together in a group, will that really help? No. So how do resource groups help? It's important to design resource groups decently because their flexibility is somewhat limited. When you create a resource, you need to specify what resource group to create it in. This means that you must create a resource group before you can create the resources that go in the group. Also, once you create a resource and specify its group, its group can't change. You can't move an existing resource from one group to another. So take some time to think about what resource groups you need and what resources to create in each one. You can always add more resource groups and resources, but once they're created, you can't move them around. Resources in IBM Cloud \u00b6 This diagram illustrates one perspective for how to view IBM Cloud: It's just a bunch of stuff running in the cloud. That stuff is resources, primarily clusters and the service instances bound to each one. This model is correct but not sufficient. IBM Cloud is a multi-tenant environment, so different tenants own and use different resources. IBM Cloud needs to keep straight which resources are owned and used by which tenants. Resources in IBM Cloud accounts \u00b6 This diagram illustrates the first level of resource organization in IBM Cloud: accounts. Each tenant has their own account. Each resource is created in exactly one account. Accounts organize resources in IBM Cloud in two key respects: Billing : An account owner is billed for the resources running in their account. (And is not billed for the resources running in other accounts.) Access : An account owner can access all of the resources in their account. Also, they can invite other users to their account and grant those users access to the account's resources. Meanwhile, the account owner and other users in an account cannot access any of the resources in any other account (unless they're invited to other accounts). This model is again correct but not sufficient. Not all users in an account should have access to all resources in an account. Resources in IBM Cloud resource groups \u00b6 A sufficiently large enterprise has multiple development teams developing multiple applications, often doing so in multiple development environments (such as one environment per team). A developer on a team should be able to access and perhaps even change the resources in their team's environment, but not other teams' environments. The account managers will probably also need one or more environments for deploying the production versions of applications, and perhaps other environments used for testing, demonstrations, and other uses. In each case, some users will need access to certain environments but should not have access to other environments. This diagram illustrates how resource groups can be used to organize resources by environment. Each resource group contains the resources for an environment, whether that environment is single tenant for a single development team or multi-tenant for the teams that share an environment. A basic environment typically consists of a single Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster and the service instances bound to that cluster. This is everything needed to host an application, whether it's a monolith or a set of microservices, or a set of applications being developed by the same team. To plan the resource groups that you'll need, plan the development teams and the environments that they'll need, plus other environments you may need for production, testing, demonstrations, etc. Today, you may only know some of those needs. Create a new resource group for each environment you know about today, ensuring to give each one a unique name. Then as you create resources for an environment, put them in the environment's resource group. In the future, as you discover the need for other environments, create more resource groups for those and create each environment's resources in its corresponding resource group. The software development lifecycle (SDLC) -- with stages like dev , test , and staging -- typically does not need separate environments, although production typically should have its own environment to isolate it from the rest of development. The stages other than production can typically be performed in the same environment to better utilize its resources. Managing access to resources \u00b6 Once we have our resources organized into resource groups, one group per environment, we then need to organize how users access these resources. This is accomplished in IAM with a combination of access groups that organize users and policies that organize the roles with permissions for accessing resources. Organize users into access groups \u00b6 An access group is a collection of users. Just like a resource group isn't a collection of random resources, an access group isn't a collection of random users. Rather, the users in an access group all do the same thing and thus need the same permissions. In role-based access control (RBAC) , users are grouped into roles and permissions are assigned to roles so that all of the users in a role get the same permissions. An access group effectively serves the same purpose as an RBAC role. Users who will perform the same tasks and therefore need the same permissions should be grouped into the same access group. An added dimension, as we'll see, is that permissions specify not only what actions the users can perform but also what resources the actions can be performed on. This diagram illustrates how a resource group is a collection of resources (as explained above, the resources for an environment) and how an access group is a collection of users: Access groups are more flexible than resource groups. Whereas a resource can only belong to a single resource group that cannot be changed, a user can belong to multiple access groups and can be added and removed whenever needed. Notice that access groups and resource groups are orthogonal, which is to say that they vary independently and are not directly related to each other. Access groups and resource groups are related, but there is no direct connection. (We'll see the indirect relationship below.) Often there are multiple access groups per resource group. The set of users in an access group has nothing to do with the set of resources in a resource group. Group members can be added to and removed from each independently. Policies connect access groups to resources \u00b6 A policy associates an access group with a resource group. Each policy is a collection of roles and each role is a collection of permissions. A policy determines the permissions that users in an access group have to perform on the resources in a resource group. This diagram illustrates how a policy associates an access group with a resource group and how the policy contains a collection of roles: A policy does not necessarily provide access to all of the resources in a resource group, but rather provides access to all resources of a particular resource type in a resource group, a collection that adjusts as resources are added to or removed from the resource group. The permissions and therefore the roles available in a policy depend on the resource type that the policy accesses. The example in the diagram shows three policies for three very common resource types: Kubernetes : Clusters, either Kubernetes or OpenShift . (The IAM roles for OpenShift clusters are the same as for Kubernetes clusters, i.e. both cluster types are the same resource type called Kubernetes Service .) Registry : The IBM Cloud Container Registry , a global multi-tenant singleton built into IBM Cloud that is its own resource type with its own set of roles. Services : Service instances created from the IBM Cloud catalog (that are IAM enabled), including services which may be added to or removed from the catalog in the future. The diagram shows each policy with Administrator and Manager roles for their respective resource type. Administrator grants permissions to use a service including creating and deleting service instances, whereas Manager grants permission to manipulate a service instance (in ways that are service-specific). The set of roles for a resource type is defined in IAM and cannot be changed by the user. Different resource types have different roles. Each role encapsulates a set of related permissions. For example, one of the permissions granted to users with the Administrator role on the Kubernetes Service resource type is containers-kubernetes.cluster.create , which enables the users to create clusters. Other roles grant cluster.read , cluster.operate , and cluster.update , but none of those can create and delete a cluster, they can only use an existing cluster. IAM -- Best Practices \u00b6 The discussion above does not attempt to describe everything that IAM can do, but rather how to use IAM well to accomplish most tasks with low complexity. These guidelines follow a set of best practices. Some of the main ones are: Assign resources to resource groups other than default : An account initially has a single resource group: default . Avoid using it. Rather: Think of development teams developing apps. Create a resource group per team for the team's environment. Assign policies to access groups, not users : Don\u2019t assign the same policy to one user after another, it\u2019ll become a maintenance nightmare. Rather, use role-based access control: Design roles, grant them permissions, and assign users to roles. Assign access to resource groups, not accounts or resources : Don\u2019t create multiple policies with the same access to different resources. Rather: Assign access to a resource group, to grant access to all resources in the resource group but not other resource groups. Best practices for assigning access has similar tips and some additional explanation. Remember, the full component diagram for IAM is quite complex. The main set of components that you should use most of the time is much simpler. Access Groups for Cloud-Native Toolkit \u00b6 As part of the Cloud Native Toolkit, we create a set of three access groups. This approach is pretty good for any account with multiple environments. This diagram illustrates the three access groups and the relative scope of permissions they provide: The three access groups are: Account Manager : Acts like an account owner to configure an account. Includes permissions to create infrastructure components including VLANs, as well as IAM components including resource groups, access groups, etc. Optionally creates clusters for the environment administrator. Environment Administrator : Owns an environment: Creates it, adds and removes services, etc. Includes permissions to create clusters, to create services, and to set RBAC within the cluster. Environment User : Uses an environment: Deploys apps, runs CI/CD pipelines, etc. No permissions to create and delete clusters or services. Does include permissions to read from and write to existing services, but not to change their configuration. An account only needs one account manager access group, but needs a pair of environment administrator and environment user access groups per environment. This enables each environment to be administered and used by a different group of users, effectively confining each group of users to their particular environment. This is the minimum needed. An account could have multiple management access groups for different aspects of account administration, and likewise an environment could have multiple administrator or user access groups for different levels of access to the environment. Access Group Example \u00b6 The previous section explained how we typically use access groups for three roles: account managers, environment administrators, and environment users. This diagram illustrates an example of the access groups for these three roles for an account that contains two development environments: The diagram shows several components: Two development environments : Two development teams, each has its own development environment. Each development environment is organized as a resource group, in this example named team1 and team2 . The first has a Kubernetes cluster while the second has an OpenShift cluster. One account manager access group : The account managers control all resource groups. They act as system administrators for the account. Two environment administrator access groups : Each resource group has its own group of environment administrators who act as site reliability engineers (SREs) of the resources in the resource group. Two environment user access groups : Each resource group has its own group of environment users who use the resources in the resource group. They typically have a development or data science role such as full-stack developer. These few access groups are a pretty good start for a typical account and may be all you'll need. You can always customize the policies in these access groups and/or add more access groups for even finer-grained access management.

Rather, use role-based access control: Design roles, grant them permissions, and assign users to roles. Assign access to resource groups, not accounts or resources : Don\u2019t create multiple policies with the same access to different resources. Rather: Assign access to a resource group, to grant access to all resources in the resource group but not other resource groups. Best practices for assigning access has similar tips and some additional explanation. Remember, the full component diagram for IAM is quite complex. The main set of components that you should use most of the time is much simpler.","title":"IAM -- Best Practices"},{"location":"resources/ibm-cloud/access-control/#access-groups-for-cloud-native-toolkit","text":"As part of the Cloud Native Toolkit, we create a set of three access groups. This approach is pretty good for any account with multiple environments. This diagram illustrates the three access groups and the relative scope of permissions they provide: The three access groups are: Account Manager : Acts like an account owner to configure an account. Includes permissions to create infrastructure components including VLANs, as well as IAM components including resource groups, access groups, etc. Optionally creates clusters for the environment administrator. Environment Administrator : Owns an environment: Creates it, adds and removes services, etc. Includes permissions to create clusters, to create services, and to set RBAC within the cluster. Environment User : Uses an environment: Deploys apps, runs CI/CD pipelines, etc. No permissions to create and delete clusters or services. Does include permissions to read from and write to existing services, but not to change their configuration. An account only needs one account manager access group, but needs a pair of environment administrator and environment user access groups per environment. This enables each environment to be administered and used by a different group of users, effectively confining each group of users to their particular environment. This is the minimum needed. An account could have multiple management access groups for different aspects of account administration, and likewise an environment could have multiple administrator or user access groups for different levels of access to the environment.","title":"Access Groups for Cloud-Native Toolkit"},{"location":"resources/ibm-cloud/access-control/#access-group-example","text":"The previous section explained how we typically use access groups for three roles: account managers, environment administrators, and environment users. This diagram illustrates an example of the access groups for these three roles for an account that contains two development environments: The diagram shows several components: Two development environments : Two development teams, each has its own development environment. Each development environment is organized as a resource group, in this example named team1 and team2 . The first has a Kubernetes cluster while the second has an OpenShift cluster. One account manager access group : The account managers control all resource groups. They act as system administrators for the account. Two environment administrator access groups : Each resource group has its own group of environment administrators who act as site reliability engineers (SREs) of the resources in the resource group. Two environment user access groups : Each resource group has its own group of environment users who use the resources in the resource group. They typically have a development or data science role such as full-stack developer. These few access groups are a pretty good start for a typical account and may be all you'll need. You can always customize the policies in these access groups and/or add more access groups for even finer-grained access management.","title":"Access Group Example"},{"location":"resources/ibm-cloud/access-control/#configuration-process","text":"Plan Installation and Configure Account document the process to set up an account to control access to development environments.

Fast-start installation does not install the base Kubernetes cluster. You need to provide the cluster before starting the toolkit installation. Choosing a Kubernetes cluster option \u00b6 The toolkit can be installed over the Kubernetes Service running on IBM Cloud or a Red Hat OpenShift cluster. However, the fast-start installer only works against a Red Hat OpenShift cluster : OpenShift on IBM Cloud Red Hat OpenShift running on IBM Cloud \u00b6 A Red Hat OpenShift cluster is the recommended production development environment. It provides enhanced developer experience and tooling over a standard Kubernetes cluster as well as additional features, such as enhanced security for production workloads. You need an active IBM Cloud account, with billing enabled, as this option will incur costs Learn on recommended production environment Incurs costs Enhanced developer experience and cluster security over standard Kubernetes No local resources needed to run cluster Kubernetes on IBM Cloud Kubernetes running on IBM Cloud \u00b6 This option provides a managed Kubernetes cluster running on the IBM Cloud. Managed Kubernetes environment Incurs costs No local resources needed to run cluster Red Hat OpenShift Red Hat OpenShift \u00b6 This option allows you to use your own installation of RedHat OpenShift as the learning environment for the Cloud-Native Toolkit. You can install OpenShift to your own hardware or use a third party cloud provider. Warning This option requires you to setup and configure an OpenShift or OKD cluster, so assumes you have the environment and skills to complete this task. If not it is recommended that you select one of the other options run on local hardware, virtualized infrastructure or cloud provider need your own OpenShift licenses the cluster must have a default storage class configured, so a persistent volume claim will be satisfied Note OKD is a community distribution of OpenShift. The fast-start installer assumes access to the RedHat Operator Hub so it can install components such as OpenShift Pipelines, so OKD is not supported. CodeReady Containers CodeReady Containers \u00b6 CodeReady Containers is a cut-down version of OpenShift to provide a local development environment on your laptop or workstation. It is freely available, but does have some limitations. Run locally on laptop or workstation no runtime costs Need 16GB memory or greater in host system No remote access from public internet services, such as github cluster access only from host system by default - no remote access to cluster over network Open Labs cluster Open Labs cluster \u00b6 Open Labs is an IBM provided online learning environment. You can access a RedHat OpenShift cluster without needing to install anything locally to your laptop or workstation. No local resources needed to run cluster No runtime costs Limited time cluster - enough time to complete the learning material, but clusters get automatically cleaned up after a few hours Obtaining your Kubernetes Cluster \u00b6 Select the option you want for your cluster, then follow the instructions. OpenShift on IBM Cloud Red Hat OpenShift running on IBM Cloud \u00b6 Sign into your IBM account Navigate to the Catalog using the link at the top of the IBM Cloud web console Search for OpenShift and select RedHat OpenShift on IBM Cloud Create a cluster.

Otherwise, leave the OCP entitlement option at the default to purchase the needed licenses Leave the Infrastructure as Classic If you have a preferred Resource Group you need to use, select it here. Check with your account admin to verify the resource group you should use if working in a company account. Otherwise, leave as Default Select your preferred Geography. It is best to select the closest geography to your location Select availability to single zone as this cluster will be used for training, so Multi-zone is not needed Select the worker zone closest to your location Enter a cluster name in the Resource details section Press Create to create your cluster Wait for the cluster to deploy - this can take several minutes, but while waiting you can install the IBM Cloud command line interface (CLI) in the next step If you don't already have the ibmcloud CLI installed on your workstation you need to install it. The instructions can be found in the IBM Cloud documentation When the OpenShift Cluster has been deployed, use the button on the IBM Cloud web console to launch the OpenShift web console If you don't already have the OpenShift command line interface (CLI) installed on your workstation, you should install it now. The installation image can be downloaded from the OpenShift web console. Select the help icon (question mark) next to your user name at the top of the web console. Select Command Line Tools from the menu, then download and install the appropriate version of the oc CLI for your workstation. Open a command terminal window on your workstation (where the ibmcloud and oc command line tooling has been installed) Login to the IBM Cloud with command ibmcloud login if you belong to a company account that has single sign on enabled, then the command is ibmcloud login --sso . If your IBM Cloud account has access to multiple accounts and you get an option to choose the account during the login process, ensure you select the account where the OpenShift cluster was deployed. If you don't see the Resource Group in the account summary presented after logging in. Use command ibmcloud target -g Default to target the correct Resource Group (this is the resource group used when deploying the cluster. The default value is Default ) Click the dropdown next to your username at the top of the OpenShift web console and select Copy Login Command . Select Display Token and copy the oc login command from the web console and paste it into the terminal on your workstation. Run the command to login to the cluster on the command line Move to the next step to install the toolkit Red Hat OpenShift Red Hat OpenShift \u00b6 For OpenShift follow the install instructions for your preferred environment Install the OpenShift or OKD cluster: Todo Add any additional post install configuration steps needed here - storage class? Once installed you need to ensure you can sign onto the OpenShift cluster using the web console (see the Web console section in the docs for details on how to access the console). Once you are signed into the console you can download and install the OpenShift Command Line Interface (CLI) tools. The CLI tools are available from the question mark icon next to you login name at the top of the OpenShift console, or from Red Hat . On your local workstation or laptop open a command prompt and sign in to your OpenShift cluster. The exact command needed is available from the OpenShift web console, select your name at the top of the screen, then in the dropdown select the Copy login command link. This will open a screen where you can select Display Token (you may be asked to authenticate again before the token is displayed) then you can copy the command line command needed to login to the cluster. CodeReady Containers CodeReady Containers \u00b6 Navigate to the Red Hat CodeReady Containers site. Select Install OpenShift on your laptop button and follow the instructions to install CodeRead Containers to your laptop. Ideally you want to increase the resources available to CodeReady containers, so use the command line options to increase memory to as much as you can spare on your laptop or workstation and expand the disk size if possible. Warning CodeReady Containers needs to adjust your laptop networking, so on some platforms it will not work alongside VPN clients needed to access corporate networks. If you need to run a VPN client, then you can install CodeReady Containers in a virtual machine on your laptop and work inside the virtual machine to access CodeReady Containers. Download and install the OpenShift Command Line Interface (CLI) tools. The CLI tools are available from the question mark icon next to you login name at the top of the OpenShift console - see section 3.3.1 in the CodeReady Containers Getting Started Guide , or from Red Hat .

There is no single way to setup an enterprise development infrastructure for cloud native application development. There are many different tools available to help create Cloud Native applications. You need to find the set of tools and processes that allow the IT organization to work efficiently to create and manage production-ready applications and services. This can be a time consuming processes, to evaluate available tools and determine how to integrate them into a development environment. The Cloud-Native toolkit is an opinionated set of tools to create a production-ready development environment. The toolkit also provides installation options and starter kits to get you up and running quickly. If you don't have access to a Cloud-Native Toolkit installation then you can select one of the setup options detailed below to install the toolkit before moving onto the learning. Options for installing the toolkit \u00b6 The Cloud-Native toolkit will run on a standard Kubernetes cluster or on the Red Hat OpenShift hybrid cloud platform, which is based on Kubernetes. The Cloud-Native toolkit supports many different options for installing and configuring the toolkit across a number of different Kubernetes based environment, but for the first install it is recommended to follow the fast-start setup. The fast-start installation will create an environment for you to learn about cloud native development. Once you have a better understanding of cloud native development you can then make informed decisions about how you want to do Cloud-Native Development within your production environment and customize the toolkit to meet your requirements. You will find additional installation and toolkit configuration options in the Adopting the toolkit section, but the recommended path for your first installation is the fast-start installation option. Prerequisites for installing the Cloud-Native Toolkit \u00b6 For all options to complete the Fast-start training your need a laptop or workstation with a modern Operating System (MS Windows, Mac OS or Linux) with an up to date browser. For IBM Cloud, bare metal, virtualized infrastructure or 3rd party cloud installs you also need to have a terminal for interacting with the cluster using command line tools. If using the IBM Cloud there is a web based command line environment available so you don't need to install additional tooling on your workstation or laptop. If using the Learning environment, you only need a browser, as the learning environment provides a web based command line environment. IBM Cloud Shell \u00b6 If you plan to use an IBM Cloud based cluster to complete the learning, then you can opt to use the IBM Cloud web based shell environment. To access the shell simply navigate to https://cloud.ibm.com/shell . The web based shell contains all the tool needed (curl, node.js, ibmcloud CLI and oc CLI) to complete the installation. Install prerequisite tools on your workstation or laptop \u00b6 If you are not planning to use the IBM Cloud shell or are going to use the online Learning environment, then you need to have some prerequisite software installed on your laptop or workstation.
