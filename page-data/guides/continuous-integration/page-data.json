This automation can be tailored to the specific project requirements.\n\nYou can read more information about Jenkins Pipelines [here](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/)\n\n### Stages\n\nPipelines are defined in a `Jenkinsfile` that sits in the root of your application code. It defines a number of stages. Each of the [<Globals name=\"templates\" />](/codepatterns/overview) includes a `Jenkinsfile` that offers a number of stages. The stages have been configured to complete the build, test, package, and deploy of the application code. Each stage can use the defined defined `secrets` and `config maps` that were previously configured during the installation of Development cluster setup.\n\n## Developer Tools Pipeline\n\nTo enable application compatibility between Kubernetes and OpenShift, the `Jenkinsfile` is consistent between pipeline registration with\nboth platforms. Also, the Docker images are built from \n[UBI images](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/introducing-red-hat-universal-base-image) \nso that their containers can run on both platforms.\n\nThese are the stages in the pipeline and a description of what each stage does. The **bold stage names** indicate \nthe stages that are required; the ***italics stage names*** indicate optional stages that can be deleted or will be ignored if the tool \nsupporting the stage is not installed. These stages represent a typical production pipeline flow for a cloud-native application.\n- **Setup**: Clones the code into the pipeline\n- **Build**: Runs the build commands for the code\n- **Test**:\tValidates the unit tests for the code\n- ***Publish pacts***:\tPublishes any pact contracts that have been defined\n- ***Sonar scan***: Runs a sonar code scan of the source code and publishes the results to SonarQube\n- **Verify environment**: Validates the OpenShift or IKS environment configuration is valid\n- **Build image**: Builds the code into a Docker images and stores it in the IBM Cloud Image registry\n- **Deploy to DEV env**:\tDeploys the Docker image tagged version to `dev` namespace using Helm Chart\n- **Health Check**: Validates the Health Endpoint of the deployed application\n- ***Package Helm Chart***: Stores the tagged version of the Helm chart in Artifactory\n- ***Trigger CD Pipeline***: This is a GitOps stage that will update the build number in designated git repo and trigger ArgoCD for deployment to **test**\n\n## Registering Pipelines\n\nThe [<Globals name=\"templates\" />](/codepatterns/overview) are a good place to start to see how `Jenkinsfile` and `Dockerfile` should be configured for use in a Jenkins CI pipeline. To register your git repo, use the [IGC CLI](/getting-started/cli). This command automates a number of manual steps you would have to do with Jenkins, including: managing secrets, webhooks, and pipeline registration in the Jenkins tools.\n\n```bash\nigc pipeline\n```\n\nBy default, the pipeline will register into the `dev` namespace and will copy all the `configMaps` and `secrets` from the `tools` namespace to the `dev` namespace. This means the pipeline can execute, knowing it has access to the key information that enables it to integrate with both the cloud platform and the various development tools. See [Cluster Configuration](/guides/cluster-configuration) for more detailed information.\n\n### Registering Pipeline in new namespace\n\nYou can use any namespace you want to register a pipeline. If you add `-n` or `namespace` to your `igc pipeline` command, it will create a new namespace if it doesn't already exist. It will copy the necessary `secrets` and `configMaps` into that namespace and configure the build agents pods to run in that namespace.\n\n```bash\nigc pipeline -n team-one\n```\n\nThis is good if you have various squads, teams, pairs or students working in the same Development Tools environment.\n\n## Continuous deployment\n\nIn addition to continuous integration, the <Globals name=\"env\" /> also supports continuous delivery\nusing Artifactory and ArgoCD:\n\n<AnchorLinks small>\n  <AnchorLink to=\"../../guides/artifact-management\">Artifact Management with Artifactory</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink to=\"../../guides/continuous-delivery\">Continuous Delivery with ArgoCD</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"a9fd4896036d1d7563cc76b43d15f651","counter":561,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Continuous Integration with Jenkins"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Continuous Integration with Jenkins\n---\n\nimport Globals from 'gatsby-theme-carbon/src/templates/Globals';\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nUse Jenkins to automate your continuous integration process\n\n</PageDescription>\n\nIn IBM Garage Method, one of the Develop practices is [continuous integration](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/code/practice_continuous_integration/).
