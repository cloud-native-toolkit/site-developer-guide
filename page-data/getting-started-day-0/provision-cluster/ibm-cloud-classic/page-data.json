Particularly, be sure to set the\nfollowing values in order to provision a Classic cluster:\n\n- `cluster_exists` to `false`\n- `vpc_cluster` to `false`\n\n### D. Configure the VLAN settings\n\nThe `vlan.tfvars` file in `terraform/settings` contains properties that define the classic infrastructure configuration in order to provision a\nnew cluster. Typical values look like this:\n\n```shell script\nvlan_datacenter=\"dal10\"\npublic_vlan_id=\"2366011\"\nprivate_vlan_id=\"2366012\"\n```\n\nYou must set all of these specifically for your cluster. Use the values provided by the account manager.\n\n- `vlan_datacenter` -- The zone in the region in which the cluster worker nodes will be provisioned\n- `public_vlan_id` -- The public VLAN that the cluster will use\n- `private_vlan_id` -- The private VLAN that the cluster will use\n\n#### Optional: Generate the VLAN properties\n\nThe [IGC CLI](/getting-started/cli) can be used to generate these settings, to make the configuration as simple as possible.\n\nIf your account has numerous VLANs and you want your cluster to use specific ones, then skip this step and provide the\nvalues by hand. This tool is for users who don't know what these required settings should be and want a simple way to\ngather reasonable defaults for their particular account.\n\n1. Log in using the <Globals name=\"igcli\" />\n2. Target the region where the cluster will be provisioned with the <Globals name=\"igcli\" />\n    ```shell script\n    ibmcloud target -r {region}\n    ```\n2. Run the VLAN command\n    ```shell script\n    igc vlan\n    ```\n3. Copy the output values from the CLI Command into your `vlan.tfvars` files\n\n### E. (Optional) Customize the installed components\n\n<br />\n\nThe `terraform/stages` directory contains the default set of stages that define the\nmodules that will be applied to the environment. The stages can be customized to change\nthe makeup of the environment that is provisioned by either removing or adding stages from/to the\n`terraform/stages` directory.\n\n**Note:** The stages occasionally have dependencies on other stages (e.g. most all\ndepend on the cluster module, many depend on the namespace module, etc.) so be aware of those\ndependencies as you start making changes. Dependencies are reflected in the `module.{stage name}` references\nin the stage variable list.\n\nThe `terraform/stages/catalog` directory contains some optional\nstages that are prep-configured and can be dropped into the `terraform/stages` directory. Other\nmodules are available from the [Garage Terraform Modules](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/garage-terraform-modules)\ncatalog and can be added as stages to the directory as well. Since this is Terraform,\nany other Terraform scripts and modules can be added to the `terraform/stages` directory\nas desired.\n\n### F. Run the installation\n\n<br />\n\n1. Open a terminal to the `ibm-garage-iteration-zero` directory\n2. Launch a [Developer Tools Docker container](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/ibm-garage-cli-tools \"Cloud Garage Tools Docker image\") from which the Terraform scripts will be run\n\n    ```shell\n    ./launch.sh\n    ```\n\n   This will download the Cloud Garage Tools Docker image that contains all the necessary tools to execute Terraform scripts\n   and exec shell into the running container. When the container starts it\n   mounts the filesystem's `./terraform/` directory as `/home/devops/src/` and loads the values from the\n   `credentials.properties` file as environment variables.\n\n3. Apply the Terraform by running the provided `runTerraform.sh` script\n\n    ```shell\n    ./runTerraform.sh\n    ```\n\n   This script collects the values provided in the `environment-ibmcloud.tfvars` and the\n   stages defined in the `terraform/stages` to build the Terraform workspace. Along the way it\n   will prompt for a couple pieces of information.\n\n    1. Type of installation: `cluster`\n\n       This prompt can be skipped by providing `--cluster` as an argument to `./runTerraform.sh`\n\n    2. Handling of an old workspace (if applicable): `keep` or `delete`\n\n       If you executed the script previously for the current cluster configuration and the workspace directory still\n       exists then you will be prompted to either keep or delete the workspace directory. Keep the workspace directory if\n       you want to use the state from the previous run as a starting point to either add or remove configuration. Delete\n       the workspace if you want to start with a clean install of the Toolkit.\n\n       This prompt can be skipped by providing `--delete` or `--keep` as an argument to `./runTerraform.sh`\n\n    3. Verify the installation configuration\n\n       The script will verify some basic settings and prompt if you want to proceed. After you select **Y** (for yes),\n       the Terraform Apply process will begin to create the infrastructure and services for your environment.\n\n       This prompt can be skipped by providing `--auto-approve` as an argument to `./runTerraform.sh`\n\n   Creating a new cluster takes about 1.5 hours on average (but can also take considerably longer)\n   and the rest of the process takes about 30 minutes.\n\n</Tab>\n\n</Tabs>\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you find that the Terraform provisioning has failed, for Private Catalog delete the workspace and for Iteration Zero  try re-running the `runTerraform.sh` script again.\nThe state will be saved and Terraform will try and apply the configuration to match the desired end state.\n\nIf you find that some of the services have failed to create in the time allocated, try the following with Iteration zero:\n\n1. Manually delete the service instances in your resource group\n3. Re-run the `runTerraform.sh` script with the `--delete` argument to clean up the state\n\n    ```shell\n    ./runTerraform.sh --delete\n    ```\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"c034e1ccb8496608c2fd570296895dd1","counter":1005,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Provision an IBM Cloud cluster","tabs":["IBM Cloud VPC","IBM Cloud Classic","Multi-Cloud"]},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Provision an IBM Cloud cluster\ntabs: ['IBM Cloud VPC', 'IBM Cloud Classic', 'Multi-Cloud']\n---\n\nimport Globals from 'gatsby-theme-carbon/src/templates/Globals';\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nSteps to prepare an environment using the <Globals name=\"shortName\" /> for <Globals name=\"ic\" />-managed clusters running on classic infrastructure.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n\n<Tabs>\n\n<Tab label=\"Private Catalog\" open=\"true\">\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\nThese steps assume the private catalog has been created and populated with the <Globals name=\"shortName\" /> tiles during\nthe [prepare the account](../prepare-account#3.-create-the-private-catalog) steps.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n<br />\n\n1.

Particularly, be sure to set the\nfollowing values in order to provision a Classic cluster:\n\n- `cluster_exists` to `false`\n- `vpc_cluster` to `false`\n\n### D. Configure the VLAN settings\n\nThe `vlan.tfvars` file in `terraform/settings` contains properties that define the classic infrastructure configuration in order to provision a\nnew cluster. Typical values look like this:\n\n```shell script\nvlan_datacenter=\"dal10\"\npublic_vlan_id=\"2366011\"\nprivate_vlan_id=\"2366012\"\n```\n\nYou must set all of these specifically for your cluster. Use the values provided by the account manager.\n\n- `vlan_datacenter` -- The zone in the region in which the cluster worker nodes will be provisioned\n- `public_vlan_id` -- The public VLAN that the cluster will use\n- `private_vlan_id` -- The private VLAN that the cluster will use\n\n#### Optional: Generate the VLAN properties\n\nThe [IGC CLI](/getting-started/cli) can be used to generate these settings, to make the configuration as simple as possible.\n\nIf your account has numerous VLANs and you want your cluster to use specific ones, then skip this step and provide the\nvalues by hand. This tool is for users who don't know what these required settings should be and want a simple way to\ngather reasonable defaults for their particular account.\n\n1. Log in using the <Globals name=\"igcli\" />\n2. Target the region where the cluster will be provisioned with the <Globals name=\"igcli\" />\n    ```shell script\n    ibmcloud target -r {region}\n    ```\n2. Run the VLAN command\n    ```shell script\n    igc vlan\n    ```\n3. Copy the output values from the CLI Command into your `vlan.tfvars` files\n\n### E. (Optional) Customize the installed components\n\n<br />\n\nThe `terraform/stages` directory contains the default set of stages that define the\nmodules that will be applied to the environment. The stages can be customized to change\nthe makeup of the environment that is provisioned by either removing or adding stages from/to the\n`terraform/stages` directory.\n\n**Note:** The stages occasionally have dependencies on other stages (e.g. most all\ndepend on the cluster module, many depend on the namespace module, etc.) so be aware of those\ndependencies as you start making changes. Dependencies are reflected in the `module.{stage name}` references\nin the stage variable list.\n\nThe `terraform/stages/catalog` directory contains some optional\nstages that are prep-configured and can be dropped into the `terraform/stages` directory. Other\nmodules are available from the [Garage Terraform Modules](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/garage-terraform-modules)\ncatalog and can be added as stages to the directory as well. Since this is Terraform,\nany other Terraform scripts and modules can be added to the `terraform/stages` directory\nas desired.\n\n### F. Run the installation\n\n<br />\n\n1. Open a terminal to the `ibm-garage-iteration-zero` directory\n2. Launch a [Developer Tools Docker container](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/ibm-garage-cli-tools \"Cloud Garage Tools Docker image\") from which the Terraform scripts will be run\n\n    ```shell\n    ./launch.sh\n    ```\n\n   This will download the Cloud Garage Tools Docker image that contains all the necessary tools to execute Terraform scripts\n   and exec shell into the running container. When the container starts it\n   mounts the filesystem's `./terraform/` directory as `/home/devops/src/` and loads the values from the\n   `credentials.properties` file as environment variables.\n\n3. Apply the Terraform by running the provided `runTerraform.sh` script\n\n    ```shell\n    ./runTerraform.sh\n    ```\n\n   This script collects the values provided in the `environment-ibmcloud.tfvars` and the\n   stages defined in the `terraform/stages` to build the Terraform workspace. Along the way it\n   will prompt for a couple pieces of information.\n\n    1. Type of installation: `cluster`\n\n       This prompt can be skipped by providing `--cluster` as an argument to `./runTerraform.sh`\n\n    2. Handling of an old workspace (if applicable): `keep` or `delete`\n\n       If you executed the script previously for the current cluster configuration and the workspace directory still\n       exists then you will be prompted to either keep or delete the workspace directory. Keep the workspace directory if\n       you want to use the state from the previous run as a starting point to either add or remove configuration. Delete\n       the workspace if you want to start with a clean install of the Toolkit.\n\n       This prompt can be skipped by providing `--delete` or `--keep` as an argument to `./runTerraform.sh`\n\n    3. Verify the installation configuration\n\n       The script will verify some basic settings and prompt if you want to proceed. After you select **Y** (for yes),\n       the Terraform Apply process will begin to create the infrastructure and services for your environment.\n\n       This prompt can be skipped by providing `--auto-approve` as an argument to `./runTerraform.sh`\n\n   Creating a new cluster takes about 1.5 hours on average (but can also take considerably longer)\n   and the rest of the process takes about 30 minutes.\n\n</Tab>\n\n</Tabs>\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you find that the Terraform provisioning has failed, for Private Catalog delete the workspace and for Iteration Zero  try re-running the `runTerraform.sh` script again.\nThe state will be saved and Terraform will try and apply the configuration to match the desired end state.\n\nIf you find that some of the services have failed to create in the time allocated, try the following with Iteration zero:\n\n1. Manually delete the service instances in your resource group\n3. Re-run the `runTerraform.sh` script with the `--delete` argument to clean up the state\n\n    ```shell\n    ./runTerraform.sh --delete\n    ```\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/ibm-garage-developer-guide/ibm-garage-developer-guide/src/pages/getting-started-day-0/provision-cluster/ibm-cloud-classic.mdx"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1054721580","1054721580","1364590287","2102389209","2102389209","2456312558","2746626797","2746626797","3037994772","3037994772","3273249464","530240012","530240012","768070550"]}
