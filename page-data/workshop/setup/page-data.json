Create OpenShift Cluster\n\n- Create an OpenShift Cluster for example:\n  - The 8 hours free Cluster on [IBM Open Labs](https://developer.ibm.com/openlabs/openshift) select lab 6 `Bring Your Own Application`\n  - Deploy a Cluster on IBM Cloud VPC2 using the [Toolkit](/getting-started-day-0/provision-cluster/ibm-cloud-vpc)\n  - On other Clouds using docs from [cloudnativetoolkit.dev/multi-cloud](https://cloudnativetoolkit.dev/getting-started-day-0/plan-installation/multi-cloud)\n  - IBM internal DTE Infrastructure access via [IBM VPN](https://ccp-ui.csplab.intranet.ibm.com/ ) or [IBM CSPLAB](https://ccp-ui.apps.labprod.ocp.csplab.local/)\n\n## 2. Install IBM Cloud Native Toolkit\n\n- Use one of the install options for example the [Quick Install](https://cloudnativetoolkit.dev/getting-started-day-0/install-toolkit/quick-install)\n    ```bash\n    curl -sfL get.cloudnativetoolkit.dev | sh -\n    ```\n\n## 3. Setup IBM Cloud Native Toolkit Workshop\n\n- Install the foundation for the workshops\n    ```bash\n    curl -sfL workshop.cloudnativetoolkit.dev | sh -\n    ```\n\n    **Notes**: \n    - The username and password for Git Admin is `toolkit` `toolkit`.  \n    - Usernames `user01` through `user15` are configured with a password of `password`.\n    - Username `userdemo` is configured with the password `password`. You can use this username if using the workshop environment\n    for self study or giving a demo.  If you are preparing the environment for a workshop you can remove `userdemo`\n    by running the `uninstall-userdemo.sh` script which is part of the [workshop](https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/cloud-native-toolkit-workshop) scripts.\n\n## 4. (Optional) Customization of the IBM Cloud Native Toolkit Workshop\n\n  - You can customize the Workshop environment by cloning the [workshop](https://github.com/cloud-native-toolkit/cloud-native-toolkit-workshop) repo\n  \n  - Some of the most common customizations are:\n\n    - You can create more than 15 users by setting a `USER_COUNT` environment variable. For example to configure 30 users use the command\n        ```bash      \n        export USER_COUNT=30 \n        ```\n\n    - You can create more than 15 projects by setting a `PROJECT_COUNT` environment variable. For example to configure 30 projects use the command\n        ```bash      \n        export PROJECT_COUNT=30 \n        ```\n\n    - You can add additional users to the workshop clusters.\n      - Create a file with one user id per line. \n      **IMPORTANT: there needs to be newline after the last entry.**\n      For example a `users.txt` file with content.  \n        ```bash      \n        additionaluserID\n        anotheruserID\n        someuserID\n\n        ```\n      **Note:** For Openshift clusters on IBM Cloud (ROKS) the user ids are their IBM IDs (email address) all lowercase \n      with an uppercase `IAM#` prefix added to the beginning. For example.\n        ```bash      \n        IAM#additionaluserid@email.com\n        IAM#anotheruserid@email.com\n        IAM#someuserid@email.com\n\n        ```\n      - Create a `ADDITIONAL_USERS_FILE` environment variable with the path and name of the file.\n        ```bash      \n        export ADDITIONAL_USERS_FILE=users.txt\n        ```\n      - The additional users will be granted the `self-provisioner` role, meaning they can create new Openshift Projects.\n        If you wish to remove this permission set an environment \n      varable `ADDITIONAL_USERS_SELF_PROVISIONER` with a value of `N`\n        ```bash      \n        export ADDITIONAL_USERS_SELF_PROVISIONER=N\n        ```\n      \n  - Once you have finished configuring your customizations, login to the cluster from the cli and run the `scripts/install.sh` script to perform the install.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"007eadf006a3270b1d748965b72f291e","counter":1128,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Setup Workshop Environment"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Setup Workshop Environment\n---\n\nimport Globals from 'gatsby-theme-carbon/src/templates/Globals';\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nProvides the steps to install the <Globals name=\"longName\"/> and setting up the  <Globals name=\"longName\"/> Workshop hands on labs.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/aFSt5cW9TlI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n## 1.
