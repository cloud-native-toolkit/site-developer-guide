The deployment environment is a namespace in a container platform like <Globals name=\"kube\" /> or <Globals name=\"ocp\" />.\nArgo CD models a collection of applications as a project and uses a Git repository to store the application's desired state.\nArgo CD is flexible in the structure of the application configuration represented in the Git repository.\n\nArgo CD supports defining Kubernetes manifests in a number of ways:\n- helm charts\n- kustomize\n- ksonnet\n- jsonnet\n- plain directory of yaml/json manifests\n- custom plugins\n\nArgo CD compares the actual state of the application in the cluster with the desired state defined in Git and determines if\nthey are out of sync. When it detects the environment is out of sync, Argo CD can be configured to either send out a\nnotification to kick off a separate reconciliation process or Argo CD can automatically synchronize the environments to\nensure they match.\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** Confidential information like passwords and security tokens should not be checked into the Git repository. [Managing secrets in Argo CD](#managing-secrets-in-argo-cd)\nprovides information on how to handle confidential information in the GitOps repo.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n## Configuring GitOps with Argo CD\n\n**Terminology:**\n\nArgo CD uses a number of terms to refer to the components\n\n- Application - A deployable unit\n\n    In the context of the <Globals name=\"env\" />, an application is one Helm chart that contains one container image\n    that was produced by one CI pipeline. While Helm charts and images could certainly be combined to make more\n    sophisticated applications in more advanced scenarios, we will be using this simple definition here.\n\n- Project - A collection of applications that make up a solution\n\n### Set up the GitOps repo\n\nArgo CD uses a Git repo to express the desired state of the Kubernetes environment. The basic setup uses one\nrepository to represent one [*project*](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/user-guide/projects/). Within that\nrepository, each [*application*](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/operator-manual/declarative-setup/#applications)\nthat makes up the project will be described in its own folder. The repository will also contain a branch for each\ndestination (i.e. cluster and namespace) into which we want to deploy the applications.\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** There is nothing special about a git repository used for git-ops. All that is required at a minimum is a hosted git\nrepository that is accessible from by the Argo CD instance.  The [Argo CD <Globals name=\"template\" />](https://github.com/IBM/template-argocd-gitops/generate)\nused in the following steps is optional and provides some application templates to help simplify some configuration activities.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n\n1. Create a new repo from the [Argo CD <Globals name=\"template\" />](https://github.com/IBM/template-argocd-gitops/generate).  **If you see a 404 error when you click on the link, you need to sign in to github.**\n\n1. Clone the project to your machine\n\n    ```shell script\n    git clone ${GIT_URL_GITOPS}\n    ```\n\n1. navigate into the directory\n\n    ```shell script\n    cd ${GIT_DIRECTORY}\n    ```\n\n1. Create and push test branch\n\n    ```shell script\n    git checkout -b test\n    git push -u origin test\n    ```\n\n### Hook the CI pipeline to the CD pipeline\n\nThe last stage in the CI pipeline updates a GitOps repository with the updated application metadata from the build. In\norder to do that, the CI pipeline needs to know which repository should be used and needs the credentials to push changes\nto that repository. As with other configuration within the pipeline, this is handled with config maps and secrets:\n\n- A secret named `git-credentials` holds the credentials the CI pipeline uses to access all the respositories in the Git host (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, etc).\nIf you used the [IGC CLI](/getting-started/cli) to register the pipeline then this secret has already been created.\n- A config map named `gitops-repo` holds the url and branch for the gitops repository.\n\nFortunately the [IGC CLI](/getting-started/cli) provides a `gitops` command to simplify this step. Information on how to use the\ncommand as well as the alternative manual steps can be found in the [IGC CLI gitops command](/getting-started/cli#gitops) section.\n\n1. Make sure to switch context to the project/namespace CI namespace\n\n    ```shell script\n    oc project ${DEV_NAMESPACE}\n    ```\n\n1. Run the `gitops` command to create the config map and secret in the CI namespace\n\n    ```shell script\n    igc gitops\n    ```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:**\n\n- For the secret to be available to the CI pipeline, the secret needs to be created in the same namespace where the\npipeline is running.\n- The value provided for `branch` is the one the pipeline will use to when committing changes to trigger the CD\npipeline.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\nAs of v2.0.0 of the Tekton tasks and the Jenkins pipelines, the CI pipeline will create a folder and the initial configuration\nfor an application deployment if it doesn't already exist. This means, there is no other manual configuration required\nto set up the repository.\n\nNow run a new Pipeline and make sure a directory for the application is created on the gitops git repository.\nThis is required before configuring ArgoCD.\n\n### Configure Release namespaces\n\nArgoCD will deploy the application into the \"releases\" namespace such as ${TEST_NAMESPACE} or ${STAGING_NAMESPACE}\n\n1. Creat a release namespace where ArgoCD will deploy the application\n\n    ```shell script\n    oc new-project ${TEST_NAMESPACE}\n    ```\n\nThe release namespaces need pull secrets for the application container images to be pull.\n\n<Tabs>\n<Tab label=\"OpenShift Image Registry\">\n\nIf you are using the OpenShift Image Registry then you need to give permission to the services accounts\nin the \"release\" namespaces to be able to pull images from the \"development\" namespaces.\n\n- Grant access to service accounts in the new `test` or `staging` namespace to pull the container image from the `dev` namespace\n\n  ```shell script\n  oc policy add-role-to-group system:image-puller system:serviceaccounts:{TEST_NAMESPACE} -n {DEV_NAMESPACE}\n  ```\n\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab label=\"IBM Container Registry\">\n\nIf you are using the IBM Container Registry then you need to copy the pull secret `all-icr-io` from the `default` namespace\nand then add this secret to the service account used by your application (ie `default` service account)\n\n- Use the Toolkit CLI to copy the secret and setup the service account\n\n  ```shell script\n  igc pull-secret ${TEST_NAMESPACE} -t default -z default\n  ```\n\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab label=\"Other Container Registries\">\n\nIf you are using an external image registry from a 3rd party provider like quay.io or dockerhub.io then you need to create\nthe pull secret of type \"docker-registry\" and add it to the service account. Check the OpenShift\nDocumentation\n[Using pull secrets](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/openshift_images/managing_images/using-image-pull-secrets.html)\n\n</Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n\n\n\n### Register the GitOps repo in ArgoCD\n\nNow that the repository has been created, we need to tell ArgoCD where it is.\n\n- Log into ArgoCD\n\n- Click on the gear icon on the left menu to access the Settings options\n\n    ![ArgoCD config](/images/argocd-config.png)\n\n- Select the `Repositories` option\n\n- Click either the `Connect Repo using HTTPS` or `Connect Repo using SSH` button at the top and provide the information\nfor the GitOps repo you just created. For `HTTPS` you can use the access token you used when you ran `igc gitops`\n\n\n### Create a project in Argo CD\n\nIn Argo CD terms, each deployable component is an application and applications are grouped into projects. Projects are not\nrequired for Argo CD to be able to deploy applications, but it helps to organize applications and provide some restrictions\non what can be done for applications that make up a project.\n\n<Tabs>\n<Tab label=\"Argo CD UI\">\n\n1. Log into the Argo CD user interface\n\n1. Click on the gear icon on the left menu to access the Settings options\n\n    ![Argo CD config](/images/argocd-config.png)\n\n1. Select the Projects option\n\n1. Press the New Project button at the top of the page\n\n1. Specify the properties for the new project\n\n    - Name - Provide the name for the project\n    - Description - A brief description of the project\n    - Source - Press Add source and pick the Git repository from the list that was added previously\n    - Destinations\n        - Add `https://kubernetes.default.svc` for the cluster url and `${TEST_NAMESPACE}` for the namespace\n        - Add `https://kubernetes.default.svc` for the cluster url and `${STAGING_NAMESPACE}` for the namespace\n    - Press Create\n\n    **Note:** Initially, the only cluster that is available is the one in which Argo CD is -\n    `https://kubernetes.default.svc`. By adding the two destinations we have allowed the project to be deployed\n    to both the `${TEST_NAMESPACE}` and `${STAGING_NAMESPACE}` namespaces within the current cluster.\n\n</Tab>\n<Tab label=\"Argo CD CLI\">\n\n1. Log in to the Argo CD CLI\n\n    ```shell script\n    argocd login {GRPC_INGRESS_HOST} --grpc-web [--sso]\n    ```\n\n    where:\n\n    - `GRPC_INGRESS_HOST` is the host name of the grpc endpoint. On <Global name=\"ocp\" /> this is the same as the UI host\n    - `--sso` is an optional flag used when sso authentication is enabled. If not using SSO then you will be prompted for\n    the username and password\n\n    The grpc url and credentials can be retrieved from the `igc credentials` command\n\n2. Create the project\n\n    ```shell script\n    argocd proj create {PROJECT} --dest {CLUSTER_HOST},{TEST_NAMESPACE} --src {GIT_REPO}\n    ```\n\n    where:\n\n    - `{PROJECT}` is the name you want to give to the project.\n    - `{CLUSTER_HOST}` is the url for the cluster server to which the project applications can be deployed. Use `https://kubernetes.default.svc` to reference the same cluster where Argo CD has been deployed. `*` can also be used to allow deployments to any server.\n    - `{TEST_NAMESPACE}` is the namespace in the cluster where the applications can be deployed. `*` can be used to indicate any namespace.\n    - `{GIT_REPO}` is the url of the git repository where the gitops config will be located or `*` if you want to allow any.\n\n    **Note:** The `--dest` and `--src` arguments can be provided multiple times if there are multiple destations and/or\n    sources that should be configured for the project\n\n</Tab>\n<Tab label=\"Argo CD custom resource\">\n\n1. Log in to the cluster from the command line\n\n2.

Apply the yaml to the cluster in the namespace where Argo CD has been deployed (e.g. `tools`)\n\n    ```shell script\n    kubectl apply -f project.yaml -n tools\n    ```\n\n</Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n### Add an application in Argo CD for each application component\n\n<InlineNotification kind=\"warning\">\n**Note:** Before continuing to setup ArgoCD, please verify that the CI Pipeline run created the directory for the application on the gitops git repository\nand the directory container the helm related files including `requirements.yaml`\n</InlineNotification>\n\nThe last step in the process is to define the application(s) within Argo CD that should be managed. This consists of\nconnecting the config within the Git repo to the cluster and namespace.\n\n<Tabs>\n<Tab label=\"Argo CD UI\">\n\n1. Log into Argo CD user interface\n\n1. Press `New Application` and provide the following values:\n\n    - `application name` - The name of the application. It is recommend to use the format of `{namespace}-{image name}`\n    - `project` - The ArgoCD project with which the application should be included\n    - `sync-policy` - The manner with which Argo CD will use to manage the deployed artifacts. `Automatic` is\n    recommended\n    - `repository url` - The Git url where the configuration is stored (restricted to git urls configured in the Argo Project)\n    - `revision` - The Git branch where the configuration for this instance is stored\n    - `path` - The path within the repository where the application config is located (should be the application name)\n    - `destination cluster` - The cluster url for the deployment\n    - `destination namespace` - The namespace where the application should be deployed (restricted to namespaces configured in the Argo Project)\n\n1. Repeat that step for each application and each environment\n\n</Tab>\n<Tab label=\"Argo CD CLI\">\n\n1. Log in to the Argo CD CLI\n\n    ```shell script\n    argocd login {GRPC_INGRESS_HOST} --grpc-web [--sso]\n    ```\n\n    where:\n\n    - `GRPC_INGRESS_HOST` is the host name of the grpc endpoint. On <Global name=\"ocp\" /> this is the same as the UI host\n    - `--sso` is an optional flag used when sso authentication is enabled. If not using SSO then you will be prompted for\n    the username and password\n\n    The grpc url and credentials can be retrieved from the `igc credentials` command\n\n2.

Use `https://kubernetes.default.svc` to reference the same cluster where Argo CD has been deployed\n\n</Tab>\n<Tab label=\"Argo CD custom resource\">\n\n1. Log in to the cluster from the command line\n\n2. Create a file named `application.yaml` with the following contents\n\n    ```yaml\n    apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1\n    kind: Application\n    metadata:\n      name: {APPLICATION NAME}\n    spec:\n      destination:\n        namespace: {TARGET NAMESPACE}\n        server: {TARGET CLUSTER}\n      project: {PROJECT NAME}\n      source:\n        path: {APPLICATION PATH}\n        repoURL: {REPO URL}\n        targetRevision: {REPO BRANCH}\n        helm:\n          valueFiles:\n            - values.yaml\n      syncPolicy:\n        automated:\n          prune: true\n          selfHeal: true\n    ```\n\n    where:\n\n    - `{APPLICATION NAME}` is the name of the application\n    - `{PROJECT NAME}` is the name of the project (the one created in the previous step or `default`)\n    - `{TARGET NAMESPACE}` is the namespace where the application should be deployed\n    - `{TARGET CLUSTER}` is the server api url for the cluster where the application should be deployed. Use `https://kubernetes.default.svc` for the same cluter where Argo CD has been deployed\n    - `{APPLICATION PATH}` is the path to the folder where the secret template was created\n    - `{REPO URL}` is the url to the git repository\n    - `{REPO BRANCH}` is the branch in the git repository that contains the application configuration\n\n3.

The plugin takes yaml\nconfiguration as input, looks up the credentials in Key Protect, and generates a secret in the cluster from the results.\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** If Argo CD was installed via the Toolkit then the plugin should already be installed and ready to use. If not, the\ninstructions for installing the plugin can be found in the [plugin documentation](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/argocd-plugin-key-protect).\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n#### Prepare the Key Protect instance\n\nAs the name suggests, the [Argo CD Key Protect plugin](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/argocd-plugin-key-protect) leverages the\ncapabilities of the Key Protect service to manage the protected information. The details for setting up and\nmanaging the Key Protect instance can be found in [Secret management with Key Protect](/tools/secret-management-with-key-protect). From\nthose instructions you can find the information required for the subsequent steps.\n\n#### Create the secret configuration\n\nThe input to the plugin is a directory that contains one or more yaml \"secret templates\". In this case the \"secret template\" provides the\nstructure of the desired secret with placeholders for the values that will be pulled from the key management system.\n\n1. Create a directory to contain the secret configuration. The [Argo CD <Globals name=\"template\" />](https://github.com/IBM/template-argocd-gitops) repository has a template in `templates/secrets-plugin` that can be copied as a starting point\n\n2. Update the values in the yaml file for the secret that will be created\n\n    ```yaml\n    apiVersion: keymanagement.ibm/v1\n    kind: SecretTemplate\n    metadata:\n      name: mysecret\n      annotations:\n        key-manager: key-protect\n        key-protect/instanceId: instance-id\n        key-protect/region: us-east\n    spec:\n      labels: {}\n      annotations: {}\n      values:\n        - name: url\n          value: https://ibm.com\n        - name: username\n          b64value: dGVhbS1jYXA=\n        - name: password\n          keyId: 36397b07-d98d-4c0b-bd7a-d6c290163684\n    ```\n\n    - The `metadata.annotations` value is optional.\n\n        - `key-manager` - the only value supported currently is `key-protect`\n        - `key-protect/instanceId` - the instance id of the key protect instance. If not provided then the `instance-id` value from the `key-protect-access` secret will be used.\n        - `key-protect/region` - the region where the key protect instance has been provisioned. If not provided then the `region` value from the `key-protect-access` secret will be used.\n\n    - The `metadata.name` value given will be used as the name for the Secret that will be generated.\n    - The information in `spec.labels` and `spec.annotations` will be copied over as the `labels` and `annotations` in the Secret that is generated\n    - The `spec.values` section contains the information that should be provided in the `data` section of the generated Secret. There are three prossible ways the values can be provided:\n\n        - `value` - the actual value can be provided directly as clear text. This would be appropriate for information that is not sensitive but is required in the secret\n        - `b64value` - a base64 encoded value can be provided to the secret. This can be used for large values that might present formatting issues or for information that is not sensitive but that might be obfuscated a bit (like a username)\n        - `keyId` - the id (not the name) of the Standard Key that has been stored in Key Protect. The value stored in Key Protect can be anything\n\n3. Commit the changes to the GitOps repository\n\n#### Add the secret application in Argo CD\n\nOnce the configuration has been added to the GitOps repository, Argo CD needs to be configured to deploy the secrets.\n\n<Tabs>\n<Tab label=\"Argo CD UI\">\n\n1. Log into Argo CD user interface\n\n1. Press `New Application` and provide the following values:\n\n    - `application name` - The name of the application.

On <Global name=\"ocp\" /> this is the same as the UI host\n    - `--sso` is an optional flag used when SSO authentication is enabled. If not using SSO then you will be prompted for\n    the username and password\n\n    The grpc url and credentials can be retrieved from the `igc credentials` command\n\n2.

To do that,\nthe target cluster must first be registered with Argo CD. After that, the cluster api server can be selected as a\ndeployment target within an application configuration. The following describes the steps required to add another cluster\nas a deployment target:\n\n1. Log in to the Argo CD CLI\n\n    ```shell script\n    argocd login {GRPC_INGRESS_HOST} --grpc-web [--sso]\n    ```\n\n    where:\n\n    - `GRPC_INGRESS_HOST` is the host name of the grpc endpoint. On <Global name=\"ocp\" /> this is the same as the UI host\n    - `--sso` is an optional flag used when sso authentication is enabled. If not using SSO then you will be prompted for\n    the username and password\n\n    The grpc url and credentials can be retrieved from the `igc credentials` command\n\n2. Log into the target cluster from the command line\n\n3. Run the Argo CD command to list the available clusters\n\n    ```shell script\n    argocd cluster add\n    ```\n\n    The currently selected cluster will be the one with the asterisk next to it.

The deployment environment is a namespace in a container platform like <Globals name=\"kube\" /> or <Globals name=\"ocp\" />.\nArgo CD models a collection of applications as a project and uses a Git repository to store the application's desired state.\nArgo CD is flexible in the structure of the application configuration represented in the Git repository.\n\nArgo CD supports defining Kubernetes manifests in a number of ways:\n- helm charts\n- kustomize\n- ksonnet\n- jsonnet\n- plain directory of yaml/json manifests\n- custom plugins\n\nArgo CD compares the actual state of the application in the cluster with the desired state defined in Git and determines if\nthey are out of sync. When it detects the environment is out of sync, Argo CD can be configured to either send out a\nnotification to kick off a separate reconciliation process or Argo CD can automatically synchronize the environments to\nensure they match.\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** Confidential information like passwords and security tokens should not be checked into the Git repository. [Managing secrets in Argo CD](#managing-secrets-in-argo-cd)\nprovides information on how to handle confidential information in the GitOps repo.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n## Configuring GitOps with Argo CD\n\n**Terminology:**\n\nArgo CD uses a number of terms to refer to the components\n\n- Application - A deployable unit\n\n    In the context of the <Globals name=\"env\" />, an application is one Helm chart that contains one container image\n    that was produced by one CI pipeline. While Helm charts and images could certainly be combined to make more\n    sophisticated applications in more advanced scenarios, we will be using this simple definition here.\n\n- Project - A collection of applications that make up a solution\n\n### Set up the GitOps repo\n\nArgo CD uses a Git repo to express the desired state of the Kubernetes environment. The basic setup uses one\nrepository to represent one [*project*](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/user-guide/projects/). Within that\nrepository, each [*application*](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/operator-manual/declarative-setup/#applications)\nthat makes up the project will be described in its own folder. The repository will also contain a branch for each\ndestination (i.e. cluster and namespace) into which we want to deploy the applications.\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** There is nothing special about a git repository used for git-ops. All that is required at a minimum is a hosted git\nrepository that is accessible from by the Argo CD instance.  The [Argo CD <Globals name=\"template\" />](https://github.com/IBM/template-argocd-gitops/generate)\nused in the following steps is optional and provides some application templates to help simplify some configuration activities.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n\n1. Create a new repo from the [Argo CD <Globals name=\"template\" />](https://github.com/IBM/template-argocd-gitops/generate).  **If you see a 404 error when you click on the link, you need to sign in to github.**\n\n1. Clone the project to your machine\n\n    ```shell script\n    git clone ${GIT_URL_GITOPS}\n    ```\n\n1. navigate into the directory\n\n    ```shell script\n    cd ${GIT_DIRECTORY}\n    ```\n\n1. Create and push test branch\n\n    ```shell script\n    git checkout -b test\n    git push -u origin test\n    ```\n\n### Hook the CI pipeline to the CD pipeline\n\nThe last stage in the CI pipeline updates a GitOps repository with the updated application metadata from the build. In\norder to do that, the CI pipeline needs to know which repository should be used and needs the credentials to push changes\nto that repository. As with other configuration within the pipeline, this is handled with config maps and secrets:\n\n- A secret named `git-credentials` holds the credentials the CI pipeline uses to access all the respositories in the Git host (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, etc).\nIf you used the [IGC CLI](/getting-started/cli) to register the pipeline then this secret has already been created.\n- A config map named `gitops-repo` holds the url and branch for the gitops repository.\n\nFortunately the [IGC CLI](/getting-started/cli) provides a `gitops` command to simplify this step. Information on how to use the\ncommand as well as the alternative manual steps can be found in the [IGC CLI gitops command](/getting-started/cli#gitops) section.\n\n1. Make sure to switch context to the project/namespace CI namespace\n\n    ```shell script\n    oc project ${DEV_NAMESPACE}\n    ```\n\n1. Run the `gitops` command to create the config map and secret in the CI namespace\n\n    ```shell script\n    igc gitops\n    ```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:**\n\n- For the secret to be available to the CI pipeline, the secret needs to be created in the same namespace where the\npipeline is running.\n- The value provided for `branch` is the one the pipeline will use to when committing changes to trigger the CD\npipeline.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\nAs of v2.0.0 of the Tekton tasks and the Jenkins pipelines, the CI pipeline will create a folder and the initial configuration\nfor an application deployment if it doesn't already exist. This means, there is no other manual configuration required\nto set up the repository.\n\nNow run a new Pipeline and make sure a directory for the application is created on the gitops git repository.\nThis is required before configuring ArgoCD.\n\n### Configure Release namespaces\n\nArgoCD will deploy the application into the \"releases\" namespace such as ${TEST_NAMESPACE} or ${STAGING_NAMESPACE}\n\n1. Creat a release namespace where ArgoCD will deploy the application\n\n    ```shell script\n    oc new-project ${TEST_NAMESPACE}\n    ```\n\nThe release namespaces need pull secrets for the application container images to be pull.\n\n<Tabs>\n<Tab label=\"OpenShift Image Registry\">\n\nIf you are using the OpenShift Image Registry then you need to give permission to the services accounts\nin the \"release\" namespaces to be able to pull images from the \"development\" namespaces.\n\n- Grant access to service accounts in the new `test` or `staging` namespace to pull the container image from the `dev` namespace\n\n  ```shell script\n  oc policy add-role-to-group system:image-puller system:serviceaccounts:{TEST_NAMESPACE} -n {DEV_NAMESPACE}\n  ```\n\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab label=\"IBM Container Registry\">\n\nIf you are using the IBM Container Registry then you need to copy the pull secret `all-icr-io` from the `default` namespace\nand then add this secret to the service account used by your application (ie `default` service account)\n\n- Use the Toolkit CLI to copy the secret and setup the service account\n\n  ```shell script\n  igc pull-secret ${TEST_NAMESPACE} -t default -z default\n  ```\n\n</Tab>\n\n<Tab label=\"Other Container Registries\">\n\nIf you are using an external image registry from a 3rd party provider like quay.io or dockerhub.io then you need to create\nthe pull secret of type \"docker-registry\" and add it to the service account. Check the OpenShift\nDocumentation\n[Using pull secrets](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/openshift_images/managing_images/using-image-pull-secrets.html)\n\n</Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n\n\n\n### Register the GitOps repo in ArgoCD\n\nNow that the repository has been created, we need to tell ArgoCD where it is.\n\n- Log into ArgoCD\n\n- Click on the gear icon on the left menu to access the Settings options\n\n    ![ArgoCD config](/images/argocd-config.png)\n\n- Select the `Repositories` option\n\n- Click either the `Connect Repo using HTTPS` or `Connect Repo using SSH` button at the top and provide the information\nfor the GitOps repo you just created. For `HTTPS` you can use the access token you used when you ran `igc gitops`\n\n\n### Create a project in Argo CD\n\nIn Argo CD terms, each deployable component is an application and applications are grouped into projects. Projects are not\nrequired for Argo CD to be able to deploy applications, but it helps to organize applications and provide some restrictions\non what can be done for applications that make up a project.\n\n<Tabs>\n<Tab label=\"Argo CD UI\">\n\n1.

The plugin takes yaml\nconfiguration as input, looks up the credentials in Key Protect, and generates a secret in the cluster from the results.\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** If Argo CD was installed via the Toolkit then the plugin should already be installed and ready to use. If not, the\ninstructions for installing the plugin can be found in the [plugin documentation](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/argocd-plugin-key-protect).\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n#### Prepare the Key Protect instance\n\nAs the name suggests, the [Argo CD Key Protect plugin](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/argocd-plugin-key-protect) leverages the\ncapabilities of the Key Protect service to manage the protected information. The details for setting up and\nmanaging the Key Protect instance can be found in [Secret management with Key Protect](/tools/secret-management-with-key-protect). From\nthose instructions you can find the information required for the subsequent steps.\n\n#### Create the secret configuration\n\nThe input to the plugin is a directory that contains one or more yaml \"secret templates\". In this case the \"secret template\" provides the\nstructure of the desired secret with placeholders for the values that will be pulled from the key management system.\n\n1. Create a directory to contain the secret configuration. The [Argo CD <Globals name=\"template\" />](https://github.com/IBM/template-argocd-gitops) repository has a template in `templates/secrets-plugin` that can be copied as a starting point\n\n2. Update the values in the yaml file for the secret that will be created\n\n    ```yaml\n    apiVersion: keymanagement.ibm/v1\n    kind: SecretTemplate\n    metadata:\n      name: mysecret\n      annotations:\n        key-manager: key-protect\n        key-protect/instanceId: instance-id\n        key-protect/region: us-east\n    spec:\n      labels: {}\n      annotations: {}\n      values:\n        - name: url\n          value: https://ibm.com\n        - name: username\n          b64value: dGVhbS1jYXA=\n        - name: password\n          keyId: 36397b07-d98d-4c0b-bd7a-d6c290163684\n    ```\n\n    - The `metadata.annotations` value is optional.\n\n        - `key-manager` - the only value supported currently is `key-protect`\n        - `key-protect/instanceId` - the instance id of the key protect instance. If not provided then the `instance-id` value from the `key-protect-access` secret will be used.\n        - `key-protect/region` - the region where the key protect instance has been provisioned. If not provided then the `region` value from the `key-protect-access` secret will be used.\n\n    - The `metadata.name` value given will be used as the name for the Secret that will be generated.\n    - The information in `spec.labels` and `spec.annotations` will be copied over as the `labels` and `annotations` in the Secret that is generated\n    - The `spec.values` section contains the information that should be provided in the `data` section of the generated Secret. There are three prossible ways the values can be provided:\n\n        - `value` - the actual value can be provided directly as clear text. This would be appropriate for information that is not sensitive but is required in the secret\n        - `b64value` - a base64 encoded value can be provided to the secret. This can be used for large values that might present formatting issues or for information that is not sensitive but that might be obfuscated a bit (like a username)\n        - `keyId` - the id (not the name) of the Standard Key that has been stored in Key Protect. The value stored in Key Protect can be anything\n\n3. Commit the changes to the GitOps repository\n\n#### Add the secret application in Argo CD\n\nOnce the configuration has been added to the GitOps repository, Argo CD needs to be configured to deploy the secrets.\n\n<Tabs>\n<Tab label=\"Argo CD UI\">\n\n1.

To do that,\nthe target cluster must first be registered with Argo CD. After that, the cluster api server can be selected as a\ndeployment target within an application configuration. The following describes the steps required to add another cluster\nas a deployment target:\n\n1. Log in to the Argo CD CLI\n\n    ```shell script\n    argocd login {GRPC_INGRESS_HOST} --grpc-web [--sso]\n    ```\n\n    where:\n\n    - `GRPC_INGRESS_HOST` is the host name of the grpc endpoint. On <Global name=\"ocp\" /> this is the same as the UI host\n    - `--sso` is an optional flag used when sso authentication is enabled. If not using SSO then you will be prompted for\n    the username and password\n\n    The grpc url and credentials can be retrieved from the `igc credentials` command\n\n2. Log into the target cluster from the command line\n\n3. Run the Argo CD command to list the available clusters\n\n    ```shell script\n    argocd cluster add\n    ```\n\n    The currently selected cluster will be the one with the asterisk next to it.
