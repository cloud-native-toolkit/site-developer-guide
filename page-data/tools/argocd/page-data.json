The deployment environment is a namespace in a container platform like <Globals name=\"kube\" /> or <Globals name=\"ocp\" />. \nArgo CD models a collection of applications as a project and uses a Git repository to store the application's desired state. \nArgo CD is flexible in the structure of the application configuration represented in the Git repository.\n\nArgo CD supports defining Kubernetes manifests in a number of ways:\n- helm charts\n- kustomize\n- ksonnet\n- jsonnet\n- plain directory of yaml/json manifests\n- custom plugins\n\nArgo CD compares the actual state of the application in the cluster with the desired state defined in Git and determines if\nthey are out of sync. When it detects the environment is out of sync, Argo CD can be configured to either send out a \nnotification to kick off a separate reconciliation process or Argo CD can automatically synchronize the environments to \nensure they match. \n\n## Configuring GitOps with Argo CD\n\n**Terminology:**\n\nArgo CD uses a number of terms to refer to the components\n\n- Application - A deployable unit\n\n    In the context of the <Globals name=\"env\" />, an application is one Helm chart that contains one container image \n    that was produced by one CI pipeline. While Helm charts and images could certainly be combined to make more \n    sophisticated applications in more advanced scenarios, we will be using this simple definition here.\n    \n- Project - A collection of applications that make up a solution\n\n### Set up the GitOps repo\n\nArgo CD uses a Git repo to express the desired state of the Kubernetes environment. The basic setup uses one \nrepository to represent one [*project*](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/user-guide/projects/). Within that \nrepository, each [*application*](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/operator-manual/declarative-setup/#applications) \nthat makes up the project will be described in its own folder. The repository will also contain a branch for each \ndestination (i.e. cluster and namespace) into which we want to deploy the applications.\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** There is nothing special about a git repository used for git-ops. All that is required at a minimum is a hosted git\nrepository that is accessible from by the Argo CD instance.  The [Argo CD <Globals name=\"template\" />](https://github.com/IBM/template-argocd-gitops/generate) \nused in the following steps is optional and provides some application templates to help simplify some configuration activities.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n1. Create a new repo from the [Argo CD <Globals name=\"template\" />](https://github.com/IBM/template-argocd-gitops/generate)\n\n1. Clone the project to your machine\n\n1. Create a branch for the environment (e.g. `test` to configure the values for deployment to the testing environment)\n\n    ```shell script\n    git checkout -b test\n    ```\n\n1. Push the test branch up to the repository\n\n    ```shell script\n    git push -u origin test\n    ```\n\n### Hook the CI pipeline to the CD pipeline\n\nThe last stage in the CI pipeline updates a GitOps repository with the updated application metadata from the build. In\norder to do that, the CI pipeline needs to know which repository should be used and needs the credentials to push changes\nto that repository. As with other configuration within the pipeline, this is handled with config maps and secrets:\n\n- A secret named `git-credentials` holds the credentials the CI pipeline uses to access all the respositories in the Git host (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, etc).\nIf you used the [IGC CLI](/getting-started/cli) to register the pipeline then this secret has already been created.\n- A secret named `gitops-repo` holds the url and branch for the gitops repository.\n\nFortunately the [IGC CLI](/getting-started/cli) provides a `gitops` command to simplify this step. Information on how to use the\ncommand as well as the alternative manual steps can be found in the [IGC CLI gitops command](/getting-started/cli#gitops) section.\n\n1. Run the `gitops` command to create the config map and secret in the CI namespace\n\n    ```shell script\n    igc gitops\n    ```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:**\n\n- For the secret to be available to the CI pipeline, the secret needs to be created in the same namespace where the \npipeline is running.\n- The value provided for `branch` is the one the pipeline will use to when committing changes to trigger the CD \npipeline.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\nAs of v2.0.0 of the Tekton tasks and the Jenkins pipelines, the CI pipeline will create a folder and the initial configuration\nfor an application deployment if it doesn't already exist. This means, there is no other manual configuration required\nto set up the repository.\n\n### Create a project in Argo CD (Optional)\n\nIn Argo CD terms, each deployable component is an application and applications are grouped into projects. Projects are not\nrequired for Argo CD to be able to deploy applications, but it helps to organize applications and provide some restrictions\non what can be done for applications that make up a project.\n\n<Tabs>\n<Tab label=\"Argo CD UI\">\n\n1.

To do that,\nthe target cluster must first be registered with Argo CD. After that, the cluster api server can be selected as a\ndeployment target within an application configuration. The following describes the steps required to add another cluster\nas a deployment target:\n\n\n1. Log in to the Argo CD CLI\n\n    ```shell script\n    argocd login {GRPC_INGRESS_HOST} --grpc-web [--sso]\n    ```\n    \n    where:\n    \n    - `GRPC_INGRESS_HOST` is the host name of the grpc endpoint. On <Global name=\"ocp\" /> this is the same as the UI host\n    - `--sso` is an optional flag used when sso authentication is enabled. If not using SSO then you will be prompted for\n    the username and password\n    \n    The grpc url and credentials can be retrieved from the `igc credentials` command\n\n2. Log into the target cluster from the command line\n\n3. Run the Argo CD command to list the available clusters \n\n    ```shell script\n    argocd cluster add\n    ```\n    \n    The currently selected cluster will be the one with the asterisk next to it. Copy the cluster id from the table\n\n4. Add the cluster to Argo CD\n\n    ```shell script\n    argocd cluster add {CLUSTER ID}\n    ```\n   \n    where:\n    \n    - `{CLUSTER ID}` is the id of the target cluster from the previous step\n\n5. Confirm the configuration by listing the known clusters\n\n    ```shell script\n    argocd cluster list\n    ```\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"ce3a1300ef4258a4f54f003dd469f9d9","counter":998,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Continuous Delivery with GitOps"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Continuous Delivery with GitOps\n---\n\nimport Globals from 'gatsby-theme-carbon/src/templates/Globals';\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nUse GitOps to continuously deliver application changes\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n[Argo CD](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-cd/) is a declarative, [GitOps](/getting-started-day-0/git-ops) [continuous delivery](/getting-started-day-2/continuous-delivery) \ntool for Kubernetes.

Apply the yaml to the cluster in the namespace where Argo CD has been deployed (e.g. `tools`)\n\n    ```shell script\n    kubectl apply -f project.yaml -n tools\n    ```\n\n</Tab>\n</Tabs>\n\n### Configure another cluster as an Argo CD deployment target\n\nArgo CD supports deploying applications into clusters other than the one into which it has been installed. To do that,\nthe target cluster must first be registered with Argo CD. After that, the cluster api server can be selected as a\ndeployment target within an application configuration. The following describes the steps required to add another cluster\nas a deployment target:\n\n\n1. Log in to the Argo CD CLI\n\n    ```shell script\n    argocd login {GRPC_INGRESS_HOST} --grpc-web [--sso]\n    ```\n    \n    where:\n    \n    - `GRPC_INGRESS_HOST` is the host name of the grpc endpoint. On <Global name=\"ocp\" /> this is the same as the UI host\n    - `--sso` is an optional flag used when sso authentication is enabled. If not using SSO then you will be prompted for\n    the username and password\n    \n    The grpc url and credentials can be retrieved from the `igc credentials` command\n\n2. Log into the target cluster from the command line\n\n3. Run the Argo CD command to list the available clusters \n\n    ```shell script\n    argocd cluster add\n    ```\n    \n    The currently selected cluster will be the one with the asterisk next to it. Copy the cluster id from the table\n\n4. Add the cluster to Argo CD\n\n    ```shell script\n    argocd cluster add {CLUSTER ID}\n    ```\n   \n    where:\n    \n    - `{CLUSTER ID}` is the id of the target cluster from the previous step\n\n5. Confirm the configuration by listing the known clusters\n\n    ```shell script\n    argocd cluster list\n    ```\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/ibm-garage-developer-guide/ibm-garage-developer-guide/src/pages/tools/argocd/index.mdx"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1364590287","2102389209","2102389209","2456312558","2746626797","2746626797","3018647132","3018647132","3037994772","3037994772","3273249464","63531786","63531786","768070550"]}
