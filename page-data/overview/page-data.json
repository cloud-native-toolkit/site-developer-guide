It embodies IBM Garage Method principles and practices for consistently developed applications incorporating best practices that increase developer velocity for efficient delivery of business value.\n\n### Overview\n\nThis short video introduces the concepts of DevOps with <Globals name=\"ocp\" />:\n<iframe width=\"80%\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GOPWObjFTsI\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n<p></p>\n\nEach development team installs its own <Globals name=\"env\" /> into the team's account. The environment includes several features that support <Globals name=\"method\" /> best practices for consistent and rapid development of cloud-native applications:\n\n- **Installation**: The <Globals name=\"shortName\"/> is able to install itself as a new <Globals name=\"env\" />\n- **Cluster**: A <Globals name=\"kube\" /> or <Globals name=\"ocp\" /> cluster that both hosts the tools and itself is a deployment target for application builds\n- **SDLC**: Deployment target environments that support the application development lifecycle: *dev*, *test*, and *staging*\n- **Backend services**: Cloud services commonly required by cloud-native applications for monitoring, security, and persistence\n- **CI/CD**: A prebuilt, ready-to-run continuous delivery pipeline incorporating best-of-breed open source software tools\n- **<Globals name=\"templates\" />**: Prebuilt code templates for common application components and tasks incorporating best practices that developers can add to their codebase as needed\n- **Dashboard**: A centralized console to help developers use the environment's capabilities\n- **Red Hat CRC**: The tools can be installed into the RedHat CodeReady Containers environment\n\nA core set of tools are sourced from the [IBM Bitnami Software Catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog?search=label%3Ahelm#software) that can be found in the <Globals name=\"ic\" />. This approach helps assemble these reliable open source development tools into an end-to-end developer experience that is fully integrated with <Globals name=\"ic\" />'s managed container orchestration services.\n\nTypically a [Cloud System Admin](/admin/overview) (such as a [squad leader](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/culture/practice-building-effective-squads/)) installs and sets up a new <Globals name=\"env\" /> after the [initial inception workshop](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/think/inception), providing a place for the developers to start developing the [minimum viable product (MVP)](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/think/inception/practice_minimum_viable_product). The objective is to reduce the time required for a team to configure and prepare their development environment. The key benefit is to make the end-to-end [CI/CD development lifecycle](https://www.ibm.com/garage/method/practices/deliver/practice_continuous_delivery/) consistent across each platform and make the out-of-the-box developer experience as simple as possible.\n\nThe installation is performed using [Terraform](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/terraform), driven by scripts with a [modular configuration](https://github.com/ibm-garage-cloud/garage-terraform-modules) so unneeded tools can be easily disabled or new tools added. The combination of tools selected are proven in the industry to deliver real value for modern cloud-native development.\n\n[Red Hat Open Innovation Labs CI/CD components](https://github.com/rht-labs/labs-ci-cd) embodies a very similar approach to how they deliver success with OpenShift.\n\n### Environment components\n\nAfter installation, the <Globals name=\"env\" /> consists of the following components and developer tools:\n- A development cluster\n- A set of backend services\n- A set of continuous delivery tools\n\nThis diagram illustrates the <Globals name=\"env\" />:\n\n![Provisioned environment](../images/catalyst-provisioned-environment.png)\n\nThe diagram shows the components in the environment: the cluster, the deployment target environments, the cloud services, and the tools.\n\n<Accordion>\n  <AccordionItem title=\"Logo Usage Reference\">\n\n| Logo      | Usage Reference |\n| --------- | ---------- |\n| Artifactory | is an
