# Customizing the Toolkit installation

One of the ways of customizing the toolkit has already been covered in the Iteration Zero script installation section.

Once the toolkit has been installed you may want to further customize the toolkit.  Some of the areas you may want to customize are:

- add new starter kits to fit your development needs
- modify or add new pipelines and pipeline tasks
- replace or add new tools to your development environment
- [Customize the dashboard](config-dashboard/dashboard.md)
